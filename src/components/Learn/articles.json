Some of the salient features of this season are mentioned below: -\n\nTrees and plants begin to sprout new leaves and flowers, making the landscape lush and colorful.\nThe maximum average temperature is around 32 degrees Celsius.\nAs the earth’s axis increases its tilt towards the sun, we experience shorter nights and longer days.\nThe festival of Holi, also known as the “Festival of Colors,\"  is celebrated during this season, usually in March. This is one of the most well-known Indian festivals that celebrate the season with bright colors everywhere.\nOther popular festivals during spring in India include Mahashivratri, Rama Navami, and Bihu.\nFarmers begin to prepare their fields for the upcoming harvest season, making it a busy time for agriculture.\nIt is a popular time for outdoor activities, such as picnics, nature walks, and sports.\nSpring also marks the end of the peak tourism season in India, making it a good time for travelers to visit without encountering large crowds.\nAfter the cold weather, when the temperature starts to rise again, it is time for flowers to bloom again. That’s why you will see numerous birds, bees, and butterflies in your garden.\nFor the emergence of flora and the celebration of regional New Year's nationwide, spring is often symbolized by rebirth, rejuvenation, transformation, new beginnings, change, warmth, optimism, and love.\n\nList of Spring Flowers in India\nThe spring season is all about bright, colorful flowers.

Prepare a list of flowering plants and celebrate this season with some of these happy blooms. \nHappy gardening!\nFAQ’s About Spring Flowers\nWhich spring flower can be grown at home easily?\nYou can grow these spring flowers at home easily – pansy, sweet pea, daffodil, lilac, petunia, zinnia, etc.\nWhere to visit in India to see the most beautiful spring flowers\nYou can witness some of the most breath-taking floral views of the spring season in these places – Kaas Pathar in Maharashtra, the Valley of Flowers in Uttarakhand, Munnar in Kerala, Dzukou Valley in Nagaland, and Yumthang Valley in Sikkim.\nIs it necessary to cut back spring flowers?\nThe type of flower and the growing circumstances determine whether or not to prune spring flowers. Certain spring plants, like tulips and daffodils, are bulbs whose foliage should be left in place until it turns brown and dies back naturally. This enables the plant to conserve energy for the bloom the following year. On the other hand, other perennials and annuals like pansies may benefit from pruning as that lengthens the blooming season.\nDo spring flowers return every year?\nSome spring-flowering plants are annuals, which live for just one growing season before dying, while others are perennials, which bloom once and then die each year. If you grow spring flowers like daffodils, crocus (kesar), tulips, iris, or hyacinths, they will bloom year after year after going dormant in winter. But annuals like pansies or petunias grow and die in the same year.\nHow much water do spring flowering plants require?\nThe amount of water required by spring flowering plants depends on the type of the plant, growing conditions, and climate. For instance, annual plants like petunias or pansies typically need more water than bulbs like tulips and daffodils. So, you must learn the particular watering requirements of the plant variety you have and modify your watering schedule accordingly.",

The core idea of sustainability is to change our habits today so that our offspring have a \"future\" on this planet.\nOne of the simplest ways to conserve nature is to bring it home, i.e., to create a garden. At this alarming time, it would be best to build a sustainable eco-garden.\nSustainable gardening is not just a list of random gardening practices but a way of life that prioritizes the long-term impact of creating an environmentally conscious space that benefits our planet's future.\nAvoiding chemicals, conserving water, or using compost are all parts of eco-gardening which is a commitment to cultivating a space that sustains and nourishes for years to come.\nCreating an eco garden can seem daunting, but it can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience with the right knowledge and ideas. We will discuss all these techniques at length here. Take a look at what follows ahead: -\n\nWhat is a sustainable eco-garden?\nReasons why sustainable eco-garden is beneficial\n10 Unique Ideas to Create a Sustainable Eco-Garden\n\nSo, let’s learn the simple eco-gardening techniques that will positively impact the world.\nWhat is a Sustainable Eco-Garden?\nA sustainable eco-garden is a garden designed and managed using sustainable practices to reduce waste, conserve water, and minimize harmful chemicals. It promotes biodiversity by providing a source of fresh, organic produce that is free from toxic pesticides and chemicals.\n A sustainable eco-garden uses various techniques, such as composting, rainwater harvesting, using organic fertilizers, planting native species, and attracting beneficial insects, to create a healthy ecosystem that supports plant and wildlife growth.\nBy prioritizing sustainability and reducing its environmental impact, a sustainable eco-garden can provide a model for responsible land use and inspire others to adopt similar practices.\nReasons Why Sustainable Eco-Garden is Beneficial?\nEnvironmental sustainability\nSustainable eco-gardens use organic practices and avoid harmful chemicals and pesticides, promoting biodiversity and supporting a healthy ecosystem.\nReduction of waste\nSustainable eco-gardens reduce waste by composting plant material, using it as fertilizer, and avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides.\nHealthier produce\nBy using organic practices, eco-gardens produce healthier, more nutritious food that is free from harmful pesticides and chemicals.\nWater conservation\nSustainable eco-gardens conserve water by using drought-tolerant plants, mulching to retain moisture, and using a drip irrigation system that delivers water directly to the roots of the plants.\nCost-effective\nSustainable eco-gardens can save money on gardening supplies by reducing the need for expensive chemical fertilizers and pesticides.\nHabitat creation\nSustainable eco-gardens provide a habitat for beneficial insects and other wildlife, which helps to support a healthy ecosystem.\nEducational opportunity\nSustainable eco-gardens provide an opportunity to learn about organic gardening practices and environmental sustainability, which can be shared with family and friends.\nReduced harm to wildlife\nAs chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and other horticultural chemicals are reduced in sustainable eco-gardens, there is less harm to wildlife.\nIncrease in soil carbon\nThe conventional methods of agriculture and horticulture have caused a decline in soil carbon due to the removal of organic matter. However, producing compost from food and plant waste and incorporating it into the soil can increase soil carbon. Moreover, this practice promotes the growth of bacteria and fungi, aiding in further carbon sequestration.\nAdditional practices such as no-dig techniques, green manures, and animal manures can also play a vital role in addressing carbon levels and mitigating the effects of climate change. So, this eco-gardening practice will help us in the long run.\n10 Unique Ideas to Create a Sustainable Eco-Garden\nMay your garden never be devoid of flowers\nEffective garden planning involves ensuring that there are blooms throughout the year in a staggered manner. This approach ensures that essential pollinators are continuously attracted to the garden, and that their beneficial effects are sustained across the seasons. One of the best solutions for implementing this idea would be planting perennial flowering plants like hibiscus, marigolds, jasmine, or periwinkle.\nFor summers, you can plan on growing zinnia, cosmos, gomphrena, etc.; for the rainy season, you may grow plumeria, balsam, or Tecoma/Yellow Elder. And for the winter season, you can grow petunia, aster, dahlia, buttercup, etc.\nGrow your favorite vegetables and fruits\nGrowing fruits, veggies, and herbs is gratifying. Producing some of your own food is a crucial component of sustainable living. Plant intensively and according to the season for a productive, sustainable vegetable plot. Crops like lettuce and greens proliferate in the spring but wither away in the heat of the summer. Hot-weather plants like tomatoes and chilies can be inter-planted in beds. You can re-sow cool weather crops when the fall weather cools off, providing three seasons' worth of food from the same area.\nGrowing fruits like lemons, strawberries, and cherries and herbs like coriander, dill, thyme, oregano, etc., is easy. Isn't it amazing that you can eat directly from your garden?\nCompanion planting – a package deal\nA practical, sustainable method is utilizing companion planting techniques, such as planting marigolds near tomatoes to repel whiteflies or growing garlic and onions alongside carrots to deter carrot root flies. It is worth researching other flower and crop combinations that can provide similar benefits when grown nearby. By implementing these techniques in your vegetable garden, you can minimize artificial pest control measures and simultaneously enhance the health and yield of your fruit and vegetable crops.\nCollect seeds once the blooming season is over\nGather the dried seed heads of annual flowers when the flowering season is over and keep them in a dry location all winter. There is no need to purchase extra seeds since you can plant them in your garden in the spring. You can use marigolds, sunflowers, and morning glory for this.\nChoose adaptive or hardy plants\nFor achieving a sustainable garden, selecting plant varieties that are highly adaptable to different weather conditions and environments is essential. By doing so, these plants will require minimal intervention and maintenance while playing a crucial role in maintaining a healthy ecology within your garden. For example, wood apples, melons, berries, etc., are some of the more resilient types of fruits. Among veggies, eggplant, cucumbers, carrots, peas, tomatoes, beans, etc., is the list you must look out for,\nGo for native plants first\nIf you want to cultivate an eco-friendly garden, it's crucial to understand the appropriate selection of plants. Sustainable plants, also referred to as \"natives,\" are species that are indigenous to your region. These plants necessitate less maintenance, typically need less water, and prosper more effectively than other perennials since they are naturally adapted to your climate, rainfall, and soil type. Moreover, native plant species nourish and shelter the native insect and bird populations.\nMulching\nMulching is an effective method to prevent the growth of unwanted weeds in your garden while also aiding in retaining soil moisture, which is crucial in areas with water restrictions. To achieve this, add a layer of mulch, approximately 2 to 3 inches thick, to your garden beds and around landscape plants. Sustainable mulching options include shredded bark, cocoa bean hulls, pine needles, grass clippings, and coir derived from coconut hulls.\nRecycle, reuse, and opt for environment-friendly pots\nIt is lucid that you cannot discard plastic or environmentally dangerous things in one go. But you can recycle those plastic cans and containers in your garden. You can use one of the milk cans to water your garden. Make drainage holes in another plastic pot to grow a plant. And buy earthen pots from a local shop to promote using environment-friendly things in your garden and support the local business.\nWater conservation\nWhen it pours, you must collect! You may use large barrels, large plastic vessels, tubs, etc., to store rainwater. In places where water is limited and scarce, using less water is a crucial component of sustainability. Many lovely drought-tolerant shrubs and perennials are used in xeriscaping, a unique gardening and planting technique that requires less watering.\nOne of the clever ways to conserve water is to bring home drought-tolerant plants like succulents. Some other ways to save water are:\n\nInstead of using sprinklers, water only the roots of the plants, avoiding the leaves, and using an eco-friendly watering can.\nOpt for large pots for plants so they won't dry out as quickly.\nAvoid mowing the grass too short in hot weather.\n\nCompost from household waste\nComposting is the process of decomposing organic material to create a nutrient-rich soil amendment that can be used in gardening and agriculture. Follow these simple steps to make compost at home:\n\nCollect organic matter such as fruit and vegetable scraps, eggshells, coffee grounds, tea bags, and garden waste like leaves and grass clippings.\nChoose a composting method that suits your space and needs. Composting can be done in a traditional outdoor bin, a tumbler, or even in a worm bin indoors. Ensure that the compost remains moist. Also, turn it regularly, and keep adequate airflow to encourage the breakdown of the organic matter.\nYou will notice that this massive collection of household waste is transformed into nutrient-rich compost that is perfect for improving the health and productivity of your garden.\n\nRemember not to add meat, dairy, and oily foods to your compost, as these materials can attract pests and slow down the decomposition process.\nThere are so many ways that we all contribute to the growing pollution level worldwide. Creating an eco-friendly garden is an intelligent, generous, and rational approach to contributing to a better tomorrow. Sustainable eco-gardening is a gradual change you can employ in your garden, which would also minimize your carbon footprint. So, read our blog and adopt some of these measures for your garden.\nHappy gardening!\nFAQs Related to Eco Garden\nWhy is a sustainable eco garden important? \nA sustainable eco-garden is important because it promotes biodiversity, reduces waste, and supports a healthy ecosystem.

The pungent smell is its identity, and that helps ward off insects.\nWe Indians don't typically associate wine and basil together, although Europeans have done so for a very long time. Basil was used by the Romans as a flavor and preservation ingredient in wine. A component of the liqueur Chartreuse is basil.\nDo you know that the Orthodox churches in Bulgaria, Romania, Macedonia, and Serbia prepare holy water with basil?\n\nHow to Grow Tulsi or Holy Basil at Home\nThe plant is incredibly easy to grow from seeds or by rooting in water, and it only requires minimal maintenance. It can be kept indoors in a pot or planted outside in a flower or vegetable garden. Read the steps below to learn how to grow Tulsi plants at home.\nGrowing Tulsi from Seeds\nPrepare soil and pot\nTake a medium-sized flower pot and fill it up with potting soil leaving about an inch of space at the top. Follow this with thorough watering. Remember, you have to moisten the soil without making it soggy.\nSow Tulsi seeds\nGet some tulsi seeds and sow them 1/4th inch deep into the prepared soil. Because tulsi seeds are so tiny, scatter them on top of the soil and use your fingers or a small tamper to gently press them into the surface.\nWatering &amp; Germination\n\nKeep the soil moist until the seeds sprout.\nWithin one to two weeks, the seeds will start to grow.\nAs the seeds are sensitive, consider misting the soil's surface with a spray bottle.\nPour water into the pot slowly and deliberately to avoid disturbing the seeds.\nThe top of the flower container should be covered with plastic wrap to help retain moisture, which will facilitate quicker germination.\nEven then, every day you should remove the wrap and check the soil to see if it requires watering or not.\n\nFurther care\n\nKeep this tulsi plant pot in a warm and sunny location at your home. If you are keeping it indoors, place it by a window where it can receive at least six to eight hours of bright, indirect sunlight.\nWhile keeping it near a window, remember that the tulsi plant doesn’t like colder temperatures, so you have to remove it from that place or close the window at night in case the temperature drops.\n\nGrowing Tulsi from Rooting in Water\nCutting a Tulsi stem\n\nChoose a stem right below a set of leaves and cut four to six inches of a mature tulsi stem.\nTake out all the remaining leaves from the bottom of your cutting. Leave around 2 inches of the stem entirely bare.\nWhile cutting the stem, take care to select a stem that hasn't flowered.\nGet a good rooting hormone from any local nursery and dip the cut end of the stem into it following instructions.

You can grow herbs in your home—indoors and outdoors—by adhering to their bare minimum requirements.\nIn this blog, we will go into greater detail about herbs and why you need to incorporate them into your diet.

These are plants that produce leaves, flowers, and seeds, which are typically used fresh or dried to add flavor to food or make teas, tinctures, and essential oils.\nBotanical Definition\nHerbs are seed-bearing plants, particularly flowering plants, that die to the ground every year. These herbal plants typically have a single, long-stemmed, and small seedling leaf structure, unlike trees, plants, and shrubs, which have a more robust, woody structure and a longer lifespan. Herbs have soft stems and a shorter life span.\nCulinary Definition\nAny green or leafy portion of a plant that is used to season and flavor food but isn't the main ingredient is referred to as an herb. So, you may ask if most of our saag like spinach or green salad like lettuce is an herb? No, because they are consumed as standalone foods rather than just as flavor enhancers for other dishes.\nDifference between Herbs and Spices\nNow, many people confuse herbs and spices.

        "articleBody": "The hotness of anything is usually compared to this tall or small, slender, and spicy vegetable.\nThere is a famous radio channel in our country by it's name, and the tagline is “It’s hot.”\nBe it red or green, their primary work is to enhance spiciness in your food.\nObviously, we are referring to chili or mirchi. Indian, Mexican, and Thai cuisines are incomplete and impossible without chilies. Mirchi is both a taste enhancer and a seasoning.\nHave you noticed that be it Mexico or India – the most popular chili-eating zones are both hot and humid? Because perspiration is produced after the consumption of chilies and has a cooling impact on the body, chilies are commonly found in hot and humid environments.\nChili is required every day at home, from breakfast to dinner recipes. So, growing it at home would be a smart idea. We will provide you with information about growing chilies at home. Here is a list of what we will discuss: -\n\nInteresting facts about Mirchi or chili\nHow to grow Mirchi or Chili plants at home easily\nHow to take care of Mirchi or Chili plants\nKey health benefits of Mirchi\n\nSo, let’s get started and know the spicy chili.\nInteresting Facts about Mirchi or Chili\n\nMirchi or chilis are varieties of the berry-fruit of Capsicum plants.\nChili peppers or mirchi are members of the nightshade family Solanaceae, which also includes tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and so on.\nCapsaicin and related chemicals known as capsaicinoids are what gives chili peppers their heat.\nDo you know that the spicy compound in chili peppers known as capsaicin is used as an analgesic in topical creams, nasal sprays, and dermal patches to treat pain?\nIt’s interesting to learn that a 2022 review of preliminary research says that regular consumption of chili peppers is linked to modest evidence of a decreased risk of mortality from cancer and cardiovascular disorders.\nContrary to popular belief, oranges do not have the highest vitamin C content among all foods. While mirchi has 143.7 mg of vitamin C per 100g, an orange contains only 53.2 mg.\nIndia is one of the largest producers and consumers of chilies, besides China, Mexico, Peru, and Spain.\n\n \nHow to Grow Mirchi or Chili Plants at Home easily\nMirchi is a necessary item in all our foods, so growing a mirchi plant isn't a bad idea. Remember that the key to successfully growing a chili plant is to ensure it gets plenty of light, heat, moisture, and humidity. Below is an explanation of how to grow the hari mirchi plant indoors: -\nSeed Germination\n\nTake a seed starter tray and fill it up with soil. Since chili seeds don't need to be sown very deeply, fill the cell to the top.\nRich soil-based compost is a fantastic soil option for chili plants. A potting mix that includes vermiculite or perlite is a good option because chili plants require adequate drainage.\nThe time of year you plant doesn't matter because you're growing the chilies indoors.\nPut two or three seeds in the tray and then add a thin layer of additional potting soil or compost over the seeds.\n\nWatering the seeds\n\nYou have to keep the soil moist and water the seeds.\nWater the soil after the seeds have been placed for faster germination.\nRemember that the soil has to be moist, not soggy.\nThe seeds will sprout in two to four weeks.\n\nCover the seed tray\n\nCovering the seed tray will help keep heat and moisture inside and promote germination.\nTake a clear plastic bag for this purpose.\n\nKeep the tray in dark\nIt's crucial to put the seeds somewhere relatively dark with some filtered light while they are germinating. Additionally, make sure the temperature is higher than 18.3 degrees Celsius. The ideal location is a shed or garage with a window. You have to keep the seeds this way until they sprout.\nRemove the cover\n\nRemove the plastic bag from the tray when you see sprouts.\nMove the tray to a cozy space with a window that will give the sprouts plenty of indirect light, such as a warm room with a skylight or a bathroom.\nUse a fluorescent tube light instead of a window if you don't have one to encourage the growth of your plants.\n\nTransplanting time\nWhen you see that the young sprouts have developed two to four sets of leaves, you have to prepare for transplant. Also, check your sprouts regularly for leaf growth as they mature.\nThin the weaker seedling\nDetermine which of your seedlings is the strongest and healthiest. Keep an eye out for taller stems, more leaf growth, and fuller leaves. Either trim the weaker seedling with scissors at the soil line or pinch it off with your fingers to remove it.\nPrepare the chili plant pot\n\nFill a small pot with potting soil and place the chili plants inside.\nBring a three-inch-wide pot and transplant the chili seedlings carefully.\nUse a mixture of sphagnum moss and old manure, or 2 inches of rich, high-quality potting soil.\n\nCarefully transplant\n\nTurn the seed starter tray over while placing your palm over the seedling's base.\nWithout damaging the roots, carefully remove the seedling and root ball from the starter tray. You can gently squeeze the seed cell to break up the soil and roots.\nTransfer the seedling to the larger pot you prepared.\nInclude just enough soil to cover the stem from the first set of leaves down.\n\nFurther care\n\nChoose a sunny window or warm location to keep the pot.\nMoisten the soil when it feels dry.\nFertilize every two weeks by feeding the plant with a combination of a balanced fertilizer with some water.\n\nHarvest\n\nAround three months after your transplant, you will see fresh chilies gracing your plant.\nYour chilies could range in length from an inch to eight inches, depending on the variety you choose.\nHarvest ripe chilies by using a knife or pair of scissors to trim the stem slightly above the fruit.\n\n \nHow to Take Care of Mirchi or Chili plants\nRead below and know how to take care of mirchi plants at home: -\nSunlight\nChilies originated in Central and South America. They were cultivated first in Mexico, which is a hot and humid place. So, this plant loves plenty of sunshine. Ensure at least four to six hours of daily sunlight.\nLocation\nChoose a location in your home that receives optimum sunlight and is warm enough to offer a hospitable environment for the growth of chilies.\nSoil\nBecause chili plants cannot endure prolonged exposure to water, the soil should be permeable. Sandy loam or black soil works best for Mirchi plants. You can also use organic potting soil and incorporate some vermicompost into it.\nSo, the ideal soil for chili plants is well-draining, porous, rich in nutrients, and has a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.\nWater\nWater only when the top layer of the soil appears dry because chilies don't need as much water as other plants do. Always check the soil before watering to avoid overwatering.\nFertilizer\nApply organic fertilizer to your plants regularly. Use cow dung, composted tea leaves, fruit peels, etc. Your plants will grow successfully if the soil is mineral-rich.\nTemperature\nWarm and humid conditions are ideal for the growth of chilies. The perfect temperature for growing chilies is between 22 and 25 degrees Celsius.\nPruning\nYou can prune the plant after the fruiting season has passed.\nMulching\nWhen cultivating mirchi plants, mulching the soil is quite helpful since it preserves soil quality and keeps the topsoil moist.\nDiseases\nNumerous diseases, including anthracnose, fruit rot, leaf spot, powdery mildew, mosaic disease, bacterial wilt, dieback, etc., can affect chili plants.

The tree is considered the “Paradise of God.”\nWait, there’s more!\nDid you know that the juice of peepal trees helps with asthma, diarrhoea, fever, toothache, cough, haematuria, scabies, joint pain, constipation, and many more? \nThe most interesting fact about the peepal tree is that, unlike other trees, it releases oxygen round-the-clock. \nWe've covered you if you plan to grow a peepal tree in your garden. In this blog, we will take you through the following:\n\nFacts to know about peepal tree\nHow to grow a peepal tree at home?\nCare tips for peepal tree\nBenefits and uses of peepal tree\n\nLet's get started.\nFacts To Know About Peepal Tree \nNative to the Indian subcontinent, Ficus Religiosa (peepal tree scientific name) is a magnificent tree. \n\nThe peepal tree has heart-shaped leaves with long drip tips that radiate wisdom vibes. \nKnown as peepal/bodhi/ or ashwatta in the local language, the tree holds great religious and historical significance. \nThese trees are considered the mythical ‘World Tree’ of the Indian subcontinent. \nFicus Religiosa is the scientific name of the peepal tree. The word ficus means ‘fig’ in Latin, the fruit of the tree. The word ‘religiosa’ means religion. \nPeepal is also the same tree under which Gautam Buddha received enlightenment. \nPeepal trees produce purple fruits encased in figs that ripen shortly after the foliage loses. \nThe bark of the peepal tree peels off with growing age. \nPeepal trees can live up to 100 years and are fast-growing plants. \n\nNow that you know about peepal trees, let's learn how to grow them at home. \nHow To Grow A Peepal Tree At Home?\nPeepal is a vast tree and can be grown in various ways. Stem cutting, seeds, and marcotting are the three ways to propagate peepal trees at home. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to grow a peepal tree at home from cutting. \nSoil Preparation\nMake a mixture of loose soil, compost, and sand. \nEnsure Proper Drainage\nAdd the mixture to a pot or a container of your choice. Make sure the pot has a proper drainage system.\nPrepare the Cuttings\nTake a peepal tree cutting, and make sharp cuts at the end, which you will dig in the soil. The size of the cuttings must be between 6ft to 7ft. \nIf you have taken a softwood cutting, you can leave some leaves on top of it. However, in the case of hardwood, it's best to remove all the leaves. \nNow take an aloe vera plant, and apply the gel at the sharp ends up to three inches.\nPlant and Water the Pot\nPlace them in the pot at least three inches deep in the soil. Add water to the soil, and ensure that it's well drained. \nPeepal Requires Humidity to Grow\nNow cut a plastic bottle in half and cover the stem. This will provide humidity to the plant.\nAfter a week, remove the plastic bottle when the leaves start coming out. \nPlacement of the Plant Pot\nWhile you can keep your plant pot in partial sunlight and direct sunlight, for appropriate results, direct sunlight is the best. \nCare Tips For Peepal Tree\n\nNow that you know how to plant and grow a peepal tree, here are some tips that will help you to take care of it. \nSoil\nThe peepal tree grows well in loose, fertile, well-draining soil with a pH below 7. If the soil is compacted, the sacred fig will not grow properly, as the roots require proper aeration. The potting soil mix will require extra organic matter and sand to reduce its heaviness. \nLight\nThe peepal plant grows well in direct sunlight and can even do well in partial sunlight. If you plan to grow the plant outdoors, always place it under the sun. The baby sacred figs are found in shady and low-light areas; big plants need more sunlight. \nWatering\nThe Ficus religiosa requires very little water. They can survive for days in drought. The soil requires moderate amounts of water only when it is dry. Once watering is done, it is crucial to ensure that the excess water drains well into the soil. It is also a fantastic tree because it survives in dry and hot conditions. When the plant is not watered for a long time, it automatically sheds all its leaves, reducing water transpiration rates and storing water in its trunks to survive the drought.\nTemperature\nLike every Ficus species, Ficus Religiosa thrives well in hot and humid conditions. The best temperature for these plants is between 13 and 35 degrees Celsius. The plant will stop growing if the temperature falls below 10 degrees Celsius. The plant undergoes dormancy during winter and doesn't grow. The tree grows after the winter and grows best in summer and spring. \nHumidity\nPeepal trees are tropical plants, so humidity is essential. The plant grows best in 40 to 80% humidity. \nFertiliser\nThe bodhi tree requires organic fertiliser once every two to four weeks during growth. Never use fertiliser on the plant during the winter season. However, fertilisers are not required once the tree grows and establishes itself.\nPruning\nTo give the plant a better shape, pruning is required. Therefore, every time foliage starts growing, cut down a few leaves. \nBenefits And Uses Of Peepal Tree\n\nThere are several health benefits of the peepal tree. These are:\nHelps With Digestion\nDrinking the decoction of the bark of the peepal tree with jaggery and salt helps treat intolerable stomach aches.

The peepal leaf acts as a laxative and is used to treat constipation.\nGood for Heart\nThe peepal leaves are also beneficial in treating heart diseases. The leaves are used to treat palpitations and weakness in the heart.\nTreats Fever &amp; Joint Pain\nThe cooling nature of the tree helps with fever and rheumatism. If you ever face such a situation, always consult an Ayurvedic doctor instead of self-medicating.\nHelp with Asthma\nThe powder of dried peepal fruit mixed with water can help treat asthma. Earlier, people used to drink the powder with honey to improve their voices.\nTreats Skin Conditions\nThe fluid received after heating and boiling the peepal tree bark is known as a decoction; it helps to deal with eczema and itching.

We will discuss the following: -\n\nFascinating facts about Kesar or Saffron\nHow to grow kesar at home easily\nHow to take care of kesar plants\nKey benefits of kesar or saffron\n\nHope you are excited to discover more about kesar! Let’s get started.\nFascinating Facts about Kesar or Saffron\n\n\nThe name Saffron perhaps comes from the old French word \"safran,\" which is based on the Arabic word \"za'farn.\" Za'farn comes from the Persian word zarparan, which means \"gold strung.\" It can allude to the flower's golden stamens or the golden hue it produces when used as a flavor.\n\nWhere did the original Kesar plant come from? The majority of the research says saffron originally came from Iran. \nMesopotamia and Greece are also believed to be potential locations for the origin of this plant.\nThere is a strong chance that Iran is the birthplace of Kesar because this country still produces over 90% of the world’s total saffron.\nIt takes around 150 to 200 flowers to produce just one gram of this spice that we love in various dishes. Why wouldn’t it then be costly?\nDo you know that the hay-like fragrance of kesar strands or threads is a result of the presence of the phytochemicals picrocrocin and safranal?\nConnoisseurs frequently compare the fragrance of saffron to metallic honey with grassy or hay-like undertones.\nDid you know that the Romans bathed in saffron?\nKesar is also believed to work as a hangover remedy. \n\nHow to Grow Kesar at Home Easily\nSaffron, an exotic spice with a distinct aroma and flavor, can be grown at home with a few simple steps. Follow the steps below to easily grow kesar or saffron at home: -\nBuy crocus corms\nCrocus corm is the bulb of the saffron plant. You have to purchase fresh corm to start your saffron plant.\nSelect a location\nBe it indoors or outdoors, select a location that receives bright sunlight and has well-draining soil. Dig the soil or opt for tilling it to help the soil loosen up.\nImprove soil\nAdd organic materials to the soil to improve its fertility. Till the area where you want to plant your corms, then mix in 10 inches of organic materials. You can make use of peat, compost, or chopped leaves. The crocus bulbs can survive the winter thanks to the nutrients from this.\nChoose containers\n\nPlanting kesar in containers might be a suitable choice for you if rats or other pests are a persistent issue in your garden.\nYou can either buy a planter with a minimum depth of 6-8 inches or make your container. To make an easy plant pot, you'll need topsoil, weed cloth, duct tape, and plastic milk crates.\nUsing weed cloth and duct tape, line plastic milk crates.\nYou should put about 5 inches of topsoil inside your milk crates.\nEnsure there are drainage holes in your planter. Make drainage holes in that plastic milk crate.\n\nPlanting time\nPlant kesar before the ground freezes or before the harsh winter arrives. Your corms should be planted 6–8 weeks before winter steps in for optimal results. This might happen in October or November.\nPlanting saffron bulbs\n\nFirst, organize your crocus corms into groups.\nSaffron blooms will flourish better if you place them in clusters as opposed to rows. Plant your crocuses in groups of 10 to 12 about 3 inches apart from one another.\nIf you are using a pot or milk crate, remember they can store only one group of 10-12 corms. If you want to plant more, then use more containers.\nCorms should be planted 3 to 4 inches deep. Dig little holes that are 3–4 inches deep and then place one corm in each hole, with the sharp end upward. Add soil over each bulb.\nIn the case of containers, set your corm on top of the 5 inches of soil you had previously applied. Then add another 2 inches of soil over your corms.\n\nWater the plants\n\nYou have to water the kesar plant throughout the fall. Saffron grows best in the autumn, so it's crucial to keep the soil moist but not soggy during this period.\nWater your corms once or twice a week to start.\nPut two fingers into the soil to check the moisture many times per week.\nStart watering only once a week if there is standing water more than a day after watering.\nStart watering three times a week if your soil is entirely dry within a day.\n\nFertilize once per season\n\nGood fertilizer options include old manure, compost, and bone meal.\nIf you reside in a region with a brief, mild spring, fertilize your kesar plant in the first few weeks of autumn.\nIf you live in an area with a long, mild spring, fertilize your kesar plant after it has finished blooming.\nWith timely fertilizing, your saffron plant will be able to survive until the following year by building up a substantial store of carbohydrates.\n\nContinue caring\nSaffron flowers are simple to grow if you take proper care. Crocus flowers should start to bloom 6 to 8 weeks after you plant your bulbs, but occasionally they won't start to bloom until the following fall, a full year after you planted your bulbs.\nHarvest and store\n\nThe outcome of your harvest is not ideal: each corm will only produce one bloom, and the bloom only yields three saffron stigmas. Consequently, your crop will only produce a meager amount of usable saffron. Your crop will only yield a small amount of useful saffron.\nOn a sunny day, when the purple Kesar flowers have fully opened, delicately pluck the vibrant orange-red stigmas from the center of each bloom. \nAfter meticulously removing each stigma from the saffron, spread them out on paper towels and store them somewhere warm and dry.\nUntil they are entirely dry, leave them alone for one to three days.\nAlways store saffron in a cool, dry place\nYou can safely store this kesar in an airtight container and use it for five years.\n\nHow to Take Care of Kesar Plants\nRead the following care instructions to grow kesar plants: -\nSunlight\nYou run the danger of receiving a poor crop if the saffron crocus plants don't receive at least four to six hours of direct sunlight during bloom time. This plant requires little shade and lots of bright light to thrive.\nLocation\nChoose a location where there is surety of at least six hours of bright sunlight. Your balcony, windowsill, backyard, front garden, porch, or terrace can be great locations if they receive copious amounts of sunlight.\nSoil\nWhen it comes to soil, surprisingly, saffron crocus is not very demanding. It can grow in any well-draining soil type. However, the best kind of soil for growing saffron or kesar plants is sandy, loamy, and humus-rich. The soil pH should be between 6.0 and 8.0.\nWater\nIn general, saffron crocus plants are moderately drought-tolerant, but too much rainfall can rot the bulbs. Light watering may be necessary only in cases of dry spell, otherwise; they may survive on only natural rainfall.\nFrom planting until harvest, kesar plants require a moderate supply of water. Just about half-an-inch of water per week is sufficient. Once the plant enters its dormancy, it doesn't need watering at all.\nTemperature\nResearch has demonstrated that the optimal saffron growing temperature for blooming is between 17 and 25 degrees Celsius. The flowering may not occur at temperatures higher than 30 degrees Celsius.\nFertilizer\nThis plant flowers quickly, so it may not require fertilizer. However, when planting Saffron Crocus bulbs, adding organic fertilizer to the soil can be beneficial. One inch of compost should be applied. As an alternative, add some bone meal to the soil before planting.\nMulching\nHarsh and frigid winters are not good for saffron plants. So, if you expect the temperatures to drop drastically, you can help protect the plants by mulching the area surrounding them with compost or straw.\nPruning\nAlthough the saffron crocus does not require pruning, when the springtime leaves turn yellow and fall off the plants, it is necessary to carefully dig up the corms.\nPests &amp; Diseases\nSaffron plant is luckily and naturally resilient and disease- and insect-resistant. There aren't many predators for saffron crocuses. This tough plant is occasionally, and infrequently may be harmed by rot or mites in addition to the hungry rabbit or gopher.\nKey Benefits of Kesar or Saffron\nKesar or saffron is a world-renowned spice.

We will talk about the following aspects: -\n\nInteresting facts about Jasmine\nHow to grow jasmine at home\nHow to take care of jasmine\nBenefits and uses of jasmine\n\nLet’s get started.\nInteresting facts about Jasmine\n\nDo you know that jasmine is a member of the Olive family (Oleaceae)?\nThere are around 200 species of jasmine, and they are either shrubs or vines.\nJasmines are generally indigenous to tropical and warm temperate regions of Africa, Eurasia, and Oceania.\nThe intoxicating fragrance of all jasmine flowers is their prime feature and a compelling reason behind their cultivation worldwide.\nThe word jasmine is derived from the middle Persian word yāsaman.\nThe jasmine shrubs can reach a height of 10–15 feet, while the vine jasmine can grow up to 25 feet.\nThe scent of jasmine flowers is intensified by the drop in nighttime temperature. This not only intensifies the scent but also reveals the star-shaped petals of the blossoms. Jasmine is known as the \"queen of the night\" in our native India because of this.\nJasmine oil is extracted from the jasmine flower which is a popular natural mood booster and stress remover.\nDo you know that jasmine is regarded as a national symbol of Hawaii, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines?\nIn Thailand, jasmine symbolizes love and respect and is associated with mothers.\nThe leaf, flower, and root of the jasmine plant are used in Ayurveda to treat skin problems, heart functions, dental issues, etc.\n\n \nHow to grow jasmine at home\nJasmine is one of the easiest flowering plants to grow at home, both indoors and outdoors. Read the growing tips explained below and benefit from the plant: -\nChoose a type of jasmine to grow at home\nThere are more than 200 varieties of jasmine. Some trees are deciduous, while others are evergreen. Some resemble vines, while others resemble bushes. So, choose a jasmine that you want to grow at home. Star jasmine or summer jasmine (Jasminum officinale), winter jasmine (Jasminum nudiflorum), pink jasmine (Jasminum polyanthum), or night flowering jasmine would be the best varieties to grow at home.\nPick a location to grow\nAlthough a few varieties can tolerate full shade, most jasmine plants need a medium to full light. Some jasmine varieties develop into vines, some spread out along the ground and act as useful ground cover, and some grow as shrubs. Choose a planting location that works with the variety you have.\nSoil Preparation\n\nOrganically rich, well-draining soil is best for jasmine flowering plants. Prepare the soil by working in a 2-inch layer of compost whether you're planting your jasmine in the ground or a pot. By doing this, the plant will produce strong blossoms throughout the growing season.\nIf you're planting outside, be sure the location has good drainage. Check that by digging a hole and pouring water. If the water soaks up easily and quickly, leaving an empty hole, the soil has good drainage.\n\nPlanting jasmine\nIt is necessary to let you know that planting jasmine from seeds will take time to mature because jasmine seeds have a low germination rate. You can also grow jasmine with the stem-cutting method. However, buying a plant from a nursery is an easier process because most of the groundwork is done.\n\nBuy a jasmine plant from a local nursery. Then gently remove the plant from the container and saturate the root system.\nCarefully scratch the roots throughout to tickle them.\nThe jasmine plant should be placed in a hole twice the size of the root ball.\nTo create a water reservoir, leave the soil around the hole a bit higher than the soil level of your plant.\nNow, to keep the jasmine plant in place, lightly pat dirt around its base.\nTo assist the plant in settling, thoroughly water the soil around the base. If additional soil is required to keep the jasmine upright, do so.\n\nSupport\nThe vine types of jasmine require good support to stay healthy.\n\nYou can use a rope to loosely attach the stems to the support to help the jasmine grow its roots into the trellis or post. Once the vine has grown, cut the knots.\nAs the vine grows, gently wrap it around a tall post or trellis that has been set up a few inches from the base of the plant. It will gradually start climbing the stake on its own.\nPlanting jasmine near a wall or fence is essential because when it grows, the fence or wall can provide ready support for it to grow upward.\n\nMoist environment\n\nDuring the growing season, water the soil to keep the jasmine plant moist but not soggy.\nOnly water the soil, not the jasmine leaves.\nWhen growing indoors, remember that jasmine needs humidity between 30 and 45%.\nUse a humidifier or frequently mist the jasmine plant indoors.\n\nFertilize the jasmine plant\nThe jasmine will continue to bloom if fertilized monthly during the growing season. Use a water-soluble, balanced fertilizer or a diluted liquid fertilizer around the base.\nPrune &amp; mulch\n\nRemove dead leaves, flowers, and stems during the growing season by pinching them off or by making a cut flush with the plant's main stem with hand pruners.\nPruning should not be done before or during the flowering season, as this can prevent blossoming.\nAfter blooming, you can trim the stems of shrub-like jasmine by a third to improve shape.\nTo protect the jasmine plants growing outside from the harsh winter season, add a few inches of mulch. Indoor jasmine plants won’t require mulching.\n\nHow to take care of jasmine\nTaking care of jasmine is quite easy. Read the instructions mentioned below and see your jasmine grow: -\nSunlight\nThe amount of sunlight varies for various species of jasmine, but most of them prefer full sun and shade. At least six hours of sunlight are essential for glorious growth, but when the sun is scorching, offer some shade.\nLocation\nPlace the jasmine plants in a location where they can receive some sunlight and shade.\nSoil\nAll types of jasmines perform best in rich, well-draining soil. So, opt for any typical peat-based potting mix with additional drainage ingredients if you are placing the jasmine indoors. Vine jasmines need a soil pH range of 5.5 to 7.0. They also demand loose, humus-rich, and extremely well-drained soil when grown outdoors.\nWater\nIt's best to maintain garden soil or potting mix at a moderate level of moisture. In the late fall and winter, the plant can be allowed to dry out a little. Make sure the pot has excellent drainage when using indoor plants.\nTemperature\nDifferent types of vining jasmine have different temperature demands. Contrary to popular belief, these plants can tolerate winter temperatures as low as 4-5 degrees Celsius with no problems. But the ideal temperature is between 15 and 23 degrees Celsius.\nFertilizer\nAround the base of the jasmine, scatter a water-soluble, balanced fertilizer, or use a diluted liquid fertilizer. You might side-dress the jasmine with compost by incorporating an inch of it into the ground close to the plant's base. Ensure to avoid disturbing the roots at all costs.\nPruning\nThose jasmine vines growing outside don’t require much pruning because they climb or spread as they wish. But when you are growing jasmine indoors, you have to prune the plant regularly. At the start of the growing season, prune them roughly to restrict excessive development and give the plant some form of framework. Pruning will keep the plants healthier and more manageable.\nPests and Diseases\nJasmine is susceptible to common household pests like scales, whiteflies, mealybugs, and aphids. The most frequent pest, mealybugs, can be gotten rid of by simply dabbing them with cotton swabs dipped in rubbing alcohol.\nRepotting\nIf you are growing jasmine indoors, it might not require repotting as often as other houseplants. However, every three years, purchase a new container and fill it up with fresh soil to repot the jasmine. Trim the roots a little while repotting to allow expansion.\nJasmine Benefits &amp; Uses\nThe leaves, roots, and flowers of jasmine have been in use in traditional medicine and Ayurveda. Read about the benefits and uses of jasmine below: -\nRelieves stress\nThe beautiful fragrance of jasmine flowers has a relaxing effect on the mind and body. If you have a jasmine plant indoors, the aroma can calm you instantly. The headache or the stress that you feel after a long day at work is all removed by the beautiful fragrance of jasmine flowers.\nMay cure liver diseases\nJasmine can treat hepatitis and other liver conditions because it has a special ingredient called oleuropein, which has antiviral properties. The consumption of jasmine prevents Hepatitis B from proliferating. In turn, this aids in the treatment of cirrhosis or liver scarring.\nHeals with antiseptic properties\nJasmine is a natural healer because it contains the antiseptics benzyl benzoate, benzoic acid, and benzaldehyde. Apply fresh jasmine oil to small cuts and wounds to get immediate relief. Additionally, breathing jasmine oil is beneficial if you have a small respiratory infection or illness. This oil also helps cure colds and coughs.\nAntispasmodic &amp; Analgesic characteristics treat stomach-related issues\nJasmine is famous for its analgesic and antispasmodic qualities. These qualities aid in treating digestive issues, including diarrhea. The smooth muscles of the intestines will relax if you drink the jasmine infusion. Also, jasmine tea or infusion can reduce body cramps and stomach pain, assisting in the battle against diarrheal symptoms.\nPromotes an alert mind, better sleep, reducing anxiety\nJasmine has components that have antidepressant and anxiolytic qualities, according to scientific studies. That’s why, when you inhale jasmine essential oil, it improves mental clarity by calming the brain.

The tree with the orange-red blossoms that can catch your attention from a distance is the one, in case you still don't know Gulmohar.\nSo, besides being incredibly beautiful and having some medicinal value, what else does Gulmohar do?\nIt offers shade and controls soil erosion in arid and semi-arid regions.\nAre you excited to learn how to grow a Gulmohar tree in your garden? This blog has all the information you would require. We would cover the following: -\n\nInteresting facts about Gulmohar\nHow to grow Gulmohar in your garden\nHow to take care of Gulmohar\nBenefits and uses of Gulmohar tree\n\nSo, let’s dive into the sparkling world of Gulmohar.\nInteresting Facts about Gulmohar\n\nDelonix regia or Gulmohar is a species of flowering plant in the bean family Fabaceae that includes legumes, peas, and beans.\nEarly in the 19th century, naturalist Wensel Bojer found the Gulmohar tree in its native Madagascar.\nThe Gulmohar flowers grow in loose clusters and feature five spoon-shaped petals. The edges are somewhat wrinkled. Color-wise, one is white with flecks of red and yellow, while the other four are scarlet.\nDo you know that the Gulmohar tree is anti-diabetic? The methanol extracts of the leaves of Gulmohar are used to reduce glucose levels in the blood.\nIn Kerala, the other name for Gulmohar is “the flower of Calvary.\" The Saint Thomas Christians in Kerala, believe that Jesus was crucified close to a little Gulmohar tree. It is also believed that Jesus Christ's blood was spilled over the Gulmohar flowers, giving them a bright red hue.\n\nHow to grow Gulmohar in your garden\nThere are two major ways to grow the Gulmohar tree in your garden. The first is from seeds, and the second is from tree cuttings. Read below and know how to grow the Gulmohar tree: -\nThe Seed Method\nGulmohar can grow naturally from seeds, and you can also use this method to grow a flaming Gulmohar tree in your front or back yard. Read below and learn how to propagate Gulmohar from seeds: -\nGetting Gulmohar seeds\nAfter pollination, a fruit or pod develops. When the pod is young, it is green and becomes brown with age. Then it splits in two, and releases hard brown seeds. You have to get these hard, brown seeds to grow a Gulmohar tree.\nHow are these Gulmohar seeds?\nThe seeds of the Gulmohar tree are physically dormant and appear tough on the outside. Without shattering this outer covering, the tree's germination is almost certainly impossible.\nGulmohar seed scarification process\n\nBefore sowing, you have to break the seed’s dormancy by weakening the outer layer through the scarification process. Either use a knife or soak the seeds in warm water for twenty-four hours. Keeping the seeds in water ensures a supply of water and oxygen, which aid in germination.\nBy lightly nicking or scratching each softening seed with a knife, you can scarify them, which allows the water inside and hastens the germination process. Some experts or experienced gardeners advise peeling the seeds with a brief touch of sandpaper.\n\nGulmohar seed germination\nThe germination period for Gulmohar seeds may last anywhere between 12 and 349 days. If you use the method for breaking the dormancy outlined above, germination occurs in 10–12 days; otherwise, it could take up to 349 days.\nPlanting Gulmohar\n\nTake a three to six inches deep seed tray\nFill up the seed tray with a well-draining potting soil\nPlant the Gulmohar seeds carefully\nRemember that each seed should be planted three inches apart and one inch deep\nPat the potting soil firmly around each seed\n\nWarm location\nAt this stage, place the tray in a warm and partially shaded area that will aid in seed germination. Maintain wet but not soggy soil. Within four to six days, seeds start to germinate.\nTransfer or repotting\nTransfer seedlings that are eight inches tall to a 1-gallon container. Select a good, sunny, and spacious location where the tree can take root and beautify your landscape.\nRemember that a Gulmohar tree grown from seeds would require anywhere between 5-12 years to mature before it starts to bloom.\nThe Cutting Method\n\nTake a cutting about one foot long with a sharp knife from a healthy Gulmohar tree\nAll the leaves from the lower portion of the cutting should be removed\nDip the stem into a rooting hormone that will enhance root development\nNow take a one-gallon container and fill it with a potting mix\nPlace the cutting carefully and moisten the soil a bit\nKeep the container away from direct sunlight and opt for a warm yet partially shady area\nIt may take several months for this cutting to grow new branches. Till then keep caring for the tree by regularly watering it.\nOnce you see new branches or leaves, take the container to a sunny area\n\nHow to Take Care of Gulmohar\nSunlight\nGulmohar trees love bright, sunny weather. At least six hours of daily sunlight are essential.\nLocation\nPlace the Gulmohar tree in your garden with lots of space for its root to develop. Also, the location should be bright and sunny.\nSoil\nClay, loamy, sandy, or gravelly - any type of soil would work for Gulmohar trees as long as it has good drainage quality. The pH range between 4.9 and 10.6 is also acceptable.\nWater\nYou need to water the plant every day in the beginning and keep the soil moist. Overwatering is not a problem, but under-watering can be harmful to the plant, especially when it is young. Water the Gulmohar tree more in the summer and considerably less in the winter. Just ensure the soil dries completely before you water.\nTemperature\nGulmohar likes warm, hot, and humid temperatures. However, Gulmohar trees cannot tolerate drought and frost. It means the extremes of both summer and winter won’t be suitable for this tree. Any temperature lower than 7 degrees Celsius or higher than perhaps 40 degrees Celsius will be a problem for Gulmohar.\nFertilizer\nAfter planting, fertilize the Gulmohar tree with a balanced liquid fertilizer for four to six weeks. Follow this two to three times a year for the upcoming three years. In early spring and winter, apply some more fertilizer. And every time you fertilize, remember to water the tree thoroughly.\nPruning\nPruning is important for Gulmohar trees because that will facilitate a sturdy structure and allow them to fight heavy winds. Start pruning the main branches that are half the diameter of the trunk or less than 8 to 12 feet from the ground. The best time for pruning is late March or early April, or as soon as the spring season starts in your area.\nPests &amp; Diseases\n\nMostly, Gulmohar is devoid of pests, but some caterpillar species may eat the foliage.\nSpider mites can also be a problem, especially if the tree is not in a wet area. Increase the humidity or move the plant outside if you find spider mites.\nIf scale bugs become a problem, take cotton swabs dipped in alcohol to treat them.\n\nWinter care\nGulmohar grows best under tropical conditions. So, in India, thorough winter care is not required unless you live in an area where the temperature drops below zero degrees Celsius. In that case, remember that frost is intolerable to the Gulmohar tree since it will rot the roots. So, cover smaller trees with burlap or a tarp overnight if there is ever a threat of frost.\nSpacing\nA Gulmohar tree can grow as high as 40 feet and as wide as between 40 and 70 feet. If the right space is not provided, this tree may cause harm to other vegetation in your garden. So, keep the Gulmohar away from any paved surfaces, walls, or other objects that it might trample.\nBenefits and Uses of Gulmohar Tree\nApart from its ornamental value, a Gulmohar tree has many benefits and uses that are explained below: -\nMay cure diarrhea\nIt is believed that the stem bark powder from the Gulmohar tree can cure diarrhea. It can help you feel better if you have several stomach-related issues.\nFixes atmospheric nitrogen\nSince the Gulmohar tree is a leguminous species, it can fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules.\nMay treat the problem of hair loss \nAccording to some websites and research, Gulmohar leaves may have magical powers that can benefit those suffering from hair loss.

From there it was transported to India and ancient China in 647 AD under the name \"Persian vegetable.\"\nChina produced 92% of the total production of spinach in the world in 2020.\nDo you know that the popularity of spinach rose with the cartoon character Popeye – the sailor man? In the 1930s, the farmers credited the boost in the production and sale of spinach to this cartoon. There was a 33% spike in the consumption of spinach, which was much needed during the Great Depression.\nThe green color of spinach is a result of the thylakoids found within its cells. They help keep one full for a long time and aid in weight loss.\nDid you know that 91% of spinach is water?\nSpinach is related to beets.\nSavoy spinach, flat-leaf spinach, and semi-savoy spinach are the only three types of spinach.\n\nHow to grow spinach at home\nGrowing spinach at home is easy. Follow our instructions mentioned below and enjoy palak recipes: -\nChoose the variety\nPick a savoy or semi-savoy type of spinach. They have dark green leaves that are crisp. If you want quicker growth, choose the smooth-leaved spinach variety. Smooth-leaved spinach is the ideal complement to any summer salad and grows fast and effortlessly.\nTime to grow\nSpinach can be grown all around the year but fall would be the best time to sow them. Plant them in September or October to enjoy spinach all through the winter season.\nPrepare soil for spinach\n\nSpinach prefers a somewhat damp habitat, but it will not thrive in soil that frequently floods or has poor drainage. So, choose a well-draining soil of any type and then raise its fertility by adding compost or fertilizer.\nCheck the soil pH which should be between 6.5 and 7.0.\nAdd manure, alfalfa meal, soybean meal, cottonseed meal, blood meal, or any other high-nitrogen fertilizer to the soil.\n\nGet spinach seeds\nGet spinach seeds from a local store and then soak them in water for 24 hours.\nSeed preparation\nA week before planting them in the soil, you must soak the seeds in water for a day. Then keep these seeds in an airtight container at a cool temperature.\nPlanting\nNow, take a medium-sized pot and fill it with 75% of the soil mix. Scatter the seeds two inches apart from each other, and then cover them with soil for half an inch.\nMulch\nTo stop weeds from growing, mulch the soil of the planting area with a few inches of hay, straw, leaves, or grass. Mulch is a fantastic weed management alternative since pulling unwanted weeds could damage the spinach's delicate roots.\nWater\nWater the soil adequately because spinach loves a moist environment.\nThinning the growth\nLightly thin your spinach seedlings as they emerge to keep the plants from fighting for space. The spinach leaves should not contact one another. To maintain this equilibrium, remove plants frequently during growth while keeping the sensitive young leaves for consumption.\nKeep moistening\nYou should water your spinach crop on average once or twice a week, depending on the environment.\nShade\nIf temperatures start to rise, you can use a shade cloth to cover the soil to reduce the temperature and keep the plants cool.\nHarvest\nYou can harvest spinach leaves as soon as they reach an appropriate size for eating, which is three to four inches long and two to three inches wide. Harvesting typically takes six to eight weeks from planting to completion.\nHow to take care of spinach\nThe spinach plant is one of the easiest to grow in your home. All you need to do is follow some basic care guidelines explained below: -\nSunlight\nSunlight is important, but only three to four hours are sufficient. This plant loves both sun and shade. So, offer some shade from the intense afternoon sun.\nLocation\nYou can grow spinach indoors and outdoors where the sun is not so strong and there is some shade. The kitchen window sill or the balcony, apart from your backyard or terrace, would work.\nSoil\nLoamy, organically rich, well-draining soil is ideal for growing spinach. The soil pH should be between 6.5 and 7.0.\nWater\nRegular watering is important for the growth of spinach vegetables. One to one-and-a-half inches of water are required every week. Now, ensure that you spread out this amount of water all over the week because if you water this amount once a week, it may lead to other problems.\nMulch\nMulching the area around the spinach plants is a good way to retain soil moisture, and it will help the plant.\nTemperature\nThe ideal temperature for growing spinach is between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius. It cannot tolerate heavy winters, and higher temperatures will result in bitter-tasting spinach leaves. Also, remember that as long as the plants' needs for soil moisture are satisfied and there is airflow around them, humidity is often not a problem.\nFertilizer\nSpinach often requires heavy fertilizer feedings because it is a fast-growing plant. If you want to keep the plant organic, you can use fish emulsion, soy meal, manure, alfalfa meal, cottonseed meal, and blood meal. According to the label instructions or after discussing with an experienced gardener, use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer while planting. Keep fertilizing the plant throughout the growing season.\nPruning\nThe best way to prune a spinach plant to maintain its strength is to harvest the leaves frequently throughout the growing season. To avoid infecting surrounding plants, it's frequently advisable to remove the entire plant if it gets infected.\nPests &amp; Diseases\nSeveral fungi diseases, including blue mold and fusarium wilt, can pose issues because spinach is produced in cool, wet climates. Try to keep the water off the spinach leaves in the evening and space your plants so they have sufficient air circulation. There is also the danger of aphids on spinach plants, which can transfer viruses. So, regularly check each spinach leaf for aphids, and if you find any, rinse them off right away. If you stay near the vicinity of wild animals, you have to protect the spinach vegetable from rabbits. Fencing would be a nice way to save your crop.\nMajor health benefits of spinach\nYou have heard from your grandparents and parents that spinach protein is essential for a healthy body and mind.

The Greek mythical character Minthe, a nymph who was changed into the fragrant plant, was the source of the name for this plant.\nMost of mint varieties are native to Asia and Europe\nThere are almost 600 types of mint plants across the world.\nDo you know that The United States of America produces 70% of the World's peppermint and spearmint?\nMint has been a symbol of true hospitality. In ancient Greece, mint was rubbed on tables to welcome guests. In the Middle East, visitors were and are still given mint tea when they arrive. In many cultures, mint was used in homes and temples to purify the air.\nThe mint flavor you find in ice cream, candies, gum, teas, jellies, syrups, and other sweets is peppermint. The mint which is used in cooking is spearmint.\nVastu experts say that rubbing some mint leaves on your cash will bring more money. Or you can store two or three leaves in your wallet or chequebook.\n\nHow to grow mint herb at home\nRead below to learn how to grow mint at home in a container using cutting methods. Growing mint from a cutting is faster and easier compared to pudina seeds which take longer to germinate and harvest.\nGrowing mint from a cutting\nArrange a mint cutting\nUse a healthy stem with brilliant green leaves only, please. Just below a node, where the plant branches out, cut the stem. After that, remove all of the leaves from the bottom, leaving 5 or 6 leaves at the top.\nWaiting for roots\nPut this cutting in a glass of cool normal water, as this will facilitate root formation. Make sure to use transparent glass so you can see when the plant starts to form roots. The bottom two inches of the cutting should be submerged in water.\nKeep the glass under the sun\n\nTo keep the stem healthy, keep the glass in a window that gets plenty of sunlight and replace the water every day. To ensure that your cutting grows rapidly, put it in a warm room or patio.\nChanging the water will prevent rotting. New roots will form underwater in a week. In the second week, the roots will be developed to a decent length.\n\nPlant the cutting\n\nIt's ready to plant when you notice tiny, white roots growing from the stem's base.\nTake a medium-sized pot and fill it with regular potting soil or peat-free multipurpose compost\nInsert the cutting 2 inches deep into the soil.\nCover the surroundings with soil and pat it\nGive your plant some water, provide sunlight, and watch it grow.\n\nWatering the new plant\nWhen you see that the soil is getting dry, water your new plant. A mint plant's soil must be moderately moist. Check the moisture of the soil with your fingers. If the mint plant is in a pot, make sure the pot has drainage holes to prevent standing water and root rot.\nPlace under partial shade\nAt this stage you have to remember that the mint plant enjoys morning sun and afternoon shade. So, place the pot accordingly.\nDepth of mint roots\nMint roots can reach depths of 12 to 18 inches easily. If you have planted the mint cutting directly into the ground, the roots will expand and new plants might quickly engulf the area. Since mint is a spreading plant, its roots require a lot of room. This is why placing the mint cutting in a container is suggested. Select a pot that is around 12 inches tall to give the roots room to expand. Plant the cuttings 2 to 3 inches apart in rows that are 18 to 24 inches apart to give your mint plants room to thrive.\nTrim the top\nMint plants grow tall quickly, and you have to trim the top of the mint plant for a better harvest.\nHarvest\nThe plant's harvesting season can be extended by pinching off flower buds as soon as they develop. The mint cutting is generally ready for harvest in six to eight weeks after planting.\nFrom the end of spring to the beginning of fall, gather as many fresh green leaves as you like. Never take more than one-third of the leaves at a time, and wait until the plant has recovered before taking more. Simply gather as much mint as you require at once.\n\n How to take care of Mint\n\nThe refreshing aroma of mint is stress-relieving, and mint is one of the easiest plants to grow at home. It won’t consume much of your time. Just stick to the instructions mentioned below and take care of the mint herbs: -\nSunlight\nMake sure the plant receives at least six hours of sunlight daily. Mint plants do best in partial shade, though they will still thrive in full sun with regular watering. However, it is advisable to shield them from the intense afternoon sun.\nLocation\nIf you are planting the mint plant outside, place it in a location where it gets partial sunlight and some shade. If placed inside, keep the mint plant pot near your windowsill.\nWater\nDuring dry spells, water your mint to keep the soil just barely damp. Mint thrives in soil that is kept just slightly damp but not saturated. Water your plant if the soil feels dry about an inch down. When growing mint indoors, either mist the plant between watering sessions to promote humidity or place the pot on a tray of pebbles and water. This is especially important during the winter months.\nSoil\nMint may grow in a variety of soil types, but rich, deep soil with a granular texture and a high content of organic matter is best for its survival. The ideal pH range is between 6.0 and 7.5. The soil should also be well-drained because mint plants enjoy moisture, but their roots can rot in damp soil.\nFertilizer\nIf your garden soil lacks nutrients, you can fertilize the mint plants from spring to fall. You can opt for a balanced all-purpose fertilizer to feed the plant throughout the growing season, right at the beginning of spring when the plants start to grow. Or spread a half teaspoon of a slow-release 16-16-8 fertilizer over each square foot of the mint bed before you plant. Incorporate compost and fertilizer into the top six inches of the bed. After incorporating the compost and fertilizer, plant the mint.\nTemperature\nAlthough mint is an adaptive plant whose adaptability varies with the species, the ideal range of temperature is between 18 and 21 degrees Celsius.\nPruning\nMint likes to cover the ground. The more you trim the stems or leaves, the more they grow. So, grow your mint in a small space, like a pot or the space between paving stones, to avoid having to perform extensive pruning upkeep.\nPests &amp; diseases\nGenerally, pests and diseases don’t impact mint plants. But some common garden pests may affect an already stressed or weak plant like whiteflies, spider mites, aphids, and mealybugs. You may also notice tiny orange spots on the underside of mint leaves and they are called rust. As a resolution, you should use a good fungicide and remember to let the plant and soil dry out completely before watering.\nSpecial care for harsh winter\nEven in the cold, mint plants are hard to kill. If your mint plant is outside, cut it back to the ground and cover it with a layer of mulch or dry leaves. Don’t remove this cover until the spring season. If you have grown mint in pots, bring them inside before it begins to frost or snow (only if you live in a cold climate). Keep the mint plant pots in a well-lit place and water only when the soil dries out.\nSignificant health benefits of mint\nThere are many varieties of mint, but spearmint and peppermint are the two most widely used across the globe.

Learn how to grow them with the following instructions: -\nFor outdoor gardening\nSeed preparation\n\nEither buy seed starting mix or make your own by combining equal parts of perlite, peat moss, and vermiculite. Fill a tray with this mix and use a spray bottle to mist the mix.\nGet the seeds of daisies and, using a pencil tip, poke the mix into a tray to make a hole. The hole can be 6.4mm deep, where you must place the seed. Remember to keep the pointed face down. Now cover the seed with the mix.\nUse a spray bottle to mist the seeds so that the seed starter mix remains moist.\n\nGermination\n\nTake a plastic sheet, cover the tray, or use a glass seed starter dome. Covering the seeds will create a warm and safe environment for germinating. Keep the seeds this way for 2-3 weeks. After that, you will notice sprouts. When the plastic is on the tray, you won't need to water it as frequently, but once it's off, you might need to water it daily to keep the medium moist.\nAlso, you have to provide enough sunshine for the seeds.

That’s why daisies are mostly found indoors in warmer climates.\nTo plant the daisies in your garden now, you must first amend the soil. Check the drainage of your garden soil and make necessary amends to it. To improve drainage, you can till the soil for 2 inches of compost before planting. You may also use peat.

The holes should have space of 12 to 18 inches in between so that there is necessary airflow. Also, don’t dig the holes too deep; otherwise, the crowns will rot.\nGently and carefully remove the seedlings from the seed tray and place them in the holes. Use the prepared soil to cover the root ball.

Water the soil with water using a mister.\nAllow the soil to dry before watering because daisies like moist but not soggy soil conditions. In the winter season, it will require less water as compared to the summer.\nPlace the pot under bright sunlight for at least 8 hours, and then, if the afternoon sun gets harsh, offer some shade.\nEvery 30 days, dissolve a 15-5-15 NPK fertilizer in the water before watering the plant to feed the daisies. In the summer, spring, and fall, it will need additional all-purpose liquid fertilizer for better blooms.\nGet rid of dead and dried leaves and flowers to promote the growth of new ones.\nContinue this care routine. It will take at least 100-130 days from the date of planting for this plant to bloom.\n\nHow to take care of daisy flowering plant\nDaisies are easy to grow in both an indoor and outdoor garden.

        "articleBody": "It may smell pungent and make you cry, but nothing can uplift the taste of vegetables better than this round, circularly layered vegetable.\nYou guessed it right – it is none other than onions.\nResearch says that organic sulfur compounds and quercetin strengthen onions to fight diseases like diabetes, cancer, and nasal congestion.\nThe world now knows and approves of the strength of onions in improving hair health. That’s why you will see many such onion-infused hair oils and other hair products on the market.\nEaten raw in salads and cooked for almost all dishes – onions, like tomatoes, add a particular weight to vegetables. They come in red, white, purple, and yellow colors, but in India, we are used to primarily eating red onions.\nWe will discover a lot of information about onions here. Today, in this blog, we will discuss the following: -\n\nInteresting facts about onions\nMajor health benefits of onion\nHow to grow onions at home easily\nHow to take care of onion plants\n\nSo, let’s start our journey of knowing onions better.\nInteresting facts about onions\n\nSince they date back thousands of years to Central Asia and the Middle East, onions are one of the oldest vegetables.\nHistorians believe that onions have been cultivated and used for more than 5000 years.\nIt’s pretty interesting to learn that the giant cells of onions facilitate the study of “cell structure” in science classes to teach the use of a microscope.\nWe know that onions are food items with medicinal uses too. But did you know that onions were used in mummification in ancient Egypt?\nThe story of Egypt doesn’t end there yet! In ancient Egypt, onions were believed to symbolize eternal life for their round shape and circular layers.\nWe all know that the Olympics originated in Greece, and thus it won’t be hard to believe that the Greek athletes were aware of some tricks to strengthen their powers. The Greek athletes and soldiers ate onions and rubbed onion juice on themselves to enhance their stamina or energy.\nIt is a long-standing custom in Greece to hang an onion on the door at the beginning of the new year to bring prosperity and health.\n\nMajor health benefits of onion\nAlmost every other dish is made with onions. They add flavor and taste to our food. Even the blandest vegetables become tasty with the addition of onions. Onions serve as a rich source of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and organic substances, making them useful in medicine. The nutritional value and the potential health benefits of onions are presented below:\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrates\n\n\n9g\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n\n\n2% of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\nFat\n\n\n0.1g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n1.1g\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n\n\n12% of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\nVitamin B6\n\n\n5% of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n\n\n4mg\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n\n\n146mg\n\n\n\n\nMagnesium\n\n\n2% of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\nIron\n\n\n1% of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\n \nMay fights against cancer\nOnions, especially red ones, have quercetin, a potent anti-cancer substance. Studies have led researchers to believe that this high quercetin content helps lower the chances of lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer.\nReduces inflammation\nThe presence of quercetin and other flavonoids makes onions worthy of treating any inflammation-related disease. They help treat allergies by preventing the cells from releasing histamine. The nasal congestion is also treated by the antihistamine properties of onions. If you are injured, onions can also heal that wound faster.\nMay controls blood sugar\nS-methyl cysteine – a sulfur compound and Quercetin present in onions may be conducive to maintaining the blood sugar level. These substances promote insulin production, making onions a must in the diet. Also, the presence of chromium may help in regulating diabetes.\nMay prevent heart-related disorders\nMany people have problems with the sharp, pungent smell and strong taste of onions. That taste and smell are due to the presence of organic sulfur compounds. These compounds are believed to reduce cholesterol and break down blood clots. Thus, the risks of heart attack or stroke are decreased considerably.\nGood for respiratory health\nOnion extracts can help people with respiratory conditions like asthma and allergic rhinitis. The prebiotics in onions can help clear nasal congestion, promoting restful sleep.\nMay prevent Alzheimer's disease\nOnions are particularly rich in flavonoids, which are plant compounds. According to one study, those who eat a long-term diet rich in flavonoids have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\nGreat for Oral Thrush\nThe sulfur compounds - thiosulfinates and thiosulfonates, which are abundant in onions, aid in the scaling down of the bacteria that cause tooth decay. Enhanced with vitamin C, onions maintain the health of the teeth. Also, tooth discomfort can be relieved by onions.\nInstrumental in hair re-growth\nOnions are abundant in antibacterial and antifungal properties, strengthening hair and boosting growth. Applying onion juice topically on the scalp may help prevent graying, thinning, and breakage and promote hair growth, even on bald patches. Onions help with good blood circulation in your scalp, promoting hair growth and treating dandruff.\nHow to grow onions at home easily:\nOnions don't need a lot of room and may be grown indoors in attractive pots. You may produce new onions from old onion scraps or seeds since onions naturally re-sprout. So, learn the onion growing techniques below: -\nFrom root bulb\n\nThe first important step in this method of growing onions is selecting a suitable container that is deep and wide with good drainage holes. Remember, the deeper your container, the bigger onion it will produce. And if your container is more expansive, you can have space to grow many onions. Onions require 3 inches of space among them. So, you can go for a 6-inch or deeper container, and the width can be adjusted according to the space you want to keep.\nFill the container with potting soil, leaving 1 inch of space. Optionally, at this stage, you may mix a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to increase the quality and size of the onions.\nNow, you need that part of the onion that you generally discard, i.e., the part from where roots grow. Save some of those discarded parts from your kitchen. You can also use an entire onion bulb.\nPlant the onion bulbs 2 inches deep into the soil and cover them with soil. Add water to moisten the soil.\nLook for a sunny spot on your balcony, kitchen window, or terrace, and place the container there. It should receive at least 6-7 hours of sunlight daily. If it is winter or cloudy outside, you can arrange for artificial plant lights.\nCheck the soil daily, and apply some water if it is dry. Remember, the soil should remain moist and not soggy. Just press the topsoil and check if it requires water or not. Depending on the outside weather, water requirements would vary. In cold climates or winter months, 2 inches of water per week is enough, while that will increase in hot climates or summer months.\nWhen the sprouts reach 3 inches in height, you can harvest them. You can also allow the bulb some more time to grow and harvest. It will take roughly four to five months to harvest.\n\nFrom seeds\n\nIt would be nice if you chose a partitioned container with drainage holes. It can be 6 inches deep and moderately wide.\nFill each cell of this container with potting soil, leaving about half an inch of space. You can apply a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to the soil only at this stage.\nBuy onion plant seeds, and plant them on top of the soil in each cell. Opt for 2-3 seeds on each cell and then cover them with a light layer of soil.\nSlightly moisten the soil so the seeds find a comfortable environment to germinate.\nPlace the pot in a sunny spot so that it receives 6-8 hours of sunlight daily.\nWater the soil whenever you see that it has dried out. If the weather is too hot or during summer months, this plant will require 3 inches of water every week.\nWhen you see the seedlings have grown to 3 inches tall, you can either harvest them or transplant them to a bigger pot or outside garden. This transplanting will assure bigger onions.\n\nHow to take care of onion plants\nOnions are one of the most easily grown vegetables. You can grow them in fancy pots indoors and use them for your kitchen requirements. Here are some care instructions that you must follow to keep the onion plants healthy: -\nSunlight\nOnions thrive in bright sunlight. It is important to offer at least 6-8 hours of full sunlight to them. They are never tired of staying under the sun.\nLocation\nA sunny spot in your home that enjoys sunlight for at least 8 hours is the best location to keep onion plants.\nSoil\nA loose, loamy soil would be best for the growth of onions. The soil for onions has to be rich in organic matter and well-drained so you may add sand to it. The ideal soil pH would be between 6.0 and 7.0.\nWater\nOnions require frequent watering to support bulb swelling. Give them 1 inch of water per week. However, avoid overwatering the bulbs or letting them linger in wet soil, as this might promote bulb rot. To keep the moisture in the soil, apply a thin layer of mulch.\nTemperature\nThe ideal temperature for the vegetative phase of onions is between 13 and 24 degrees Celsius. For bulb development, the optimal temperature should be between 16 and 25 degrees Celsius.\nFertilizer\nOnions are moderately heavy feeders. To encourage leaf growth, which will result in large bulbs, fertilize them every few weeks with a high-nitrogen fertilizer. The moment the soil cracks around the bulb, you will know that the foliage growing cycle is over, and you can stop fertilizing the plant now.\nOnions are used as a taste enhancer in all our kitchens. When you grow this root vegetable in your garden, you know it is devoid of chemical fertilizers or harmful pesticides. Moreover, it is easy to grow. So, try your hands at gardening and grow tasty onions.\nFAQs related to Onions\nIs it good to have raw onions?\nYes, it is good to have raw onions. Onions contain organic sulfur compounds, and you acquire most of them by eating them raw. These compounds help reduce the risk of heart disease and aid your body in combating many other threats of ailments.\nHow long will it take my onion plants to grow onions?\nThe onion plants, given reasonable care, would be ready for harvest within 80–150 days from the planting date.\nEating how much onion is considered healthy?\nYou may eat a medium-sized onion, which, when chopped, is equal to roughly a cup.\nDo onions like wet or dry soil?\nOnions thrive in slightly moist soil. So, when watering, make sure not to make the soil soggy.\nCan one onion be used to grow another onion?\nYou may grow your onions from cuttings by slicing off the bottom of an onion bulb and placing it in soil.\nWhen is onion harvested in India?\nIn India, onions are harvested twice a year: once from November to January and again from January to May.",

It is derived from the Greek words Helios meaning “sun” and anthos meaning “flower.”\n\nThis plant was first domesticated in the Americas.\nThe 16th century saw the introduction of sunflower seeds from the Americas to Europe. At this time, sunflower oil became an inseparable part of cooking.\nDo you know that Russia and Ukraine produce over half of the sunflower seed worldwide?\nIt may surprise you to know that a single sunflower is made up of countless tiny blossoms. The blossom is called the head, while the yellow petals and fuzzy brown cores are separate blooms.\nEach sunflower has 1000-2000 seeds.\n\nSignificant benefits of sunflowers\nMost sunflowers are used for sunflower oil and sunflower seeds. Both of these have significant health benefits that are explained below: -\nSunflower oil\nCardiovascular benefits\nLow in saturated fat and high in vitamin E – that sums up sunflower oil for you. Phytochemicals like choline and phenolic acid are also present in this oil, making it suitable for your heart.

For instance, planting a circle of sunflowers around your compost pile would hide it from view, and the compost's nutrients would help the sunflowers grow up healthy and robust.\nHow to grow sunflower plants easily at home\nSunflowers are annual flowering plants that loudly announce the summer season. Depending on the seeds you have used, this plant can reach two to fifteen feet. Check the steps mentioned below to grow them successfully at home: -\nChoose a favorable spot\nBe it on your terrace, balcony, or garden outside, you must ensure the spot receives sunlight for 6–8 hours daily. Sunflowers do best in warm to hot areas with constant daylight. Sunflowers flourish in climates with long, scorching summers.\nTest your soil\nGet a soil test kit and perform a soil pH test to know the exact level. Sunflowers do well in soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. If the soil pH is more than 6.0 or above 7.5, use compost or mix granular sulfur, respectively. Although sunflowers will grow in any soil, an ideal pH will yield better-quality flowers.\nWell-draining soil\nBefore planting, you have to be sure of the soil's drainage. Sunflowers generally do well in all soil types, but if the soil is heavy and doesn't drain easily, it may damage the roots.\nIdeal time to plant\nSunflower seeds should be planted in the early summer after the soil has thoroughly warmed. This often takes place in late May to mid-April.\nPlanting\n\nUsing a hand trowel or your hands, loosen the soil. When planting sunflower seeds, the soil should be loose and light. Add three to four inches of compost to soil that lacks nutrients or drains poorly.\nNow use a shovel or hands to dig one-inch hole to place the seeds. If planting in rows, keep 30 inches gap.\nPut seeds in the hole and cover it with soil\nNow you can mix a thin layer of fertilizer. Opt for organic fertilizer, and they will ensure sturdy stalks.\n\nWater\nWater the soil thoroughly, but remember not to drench it. Due to their strong roots, sunflowers prefer infrequent, intense watering to frequent, shallow watering. Change your watering schedule on weeks when it's very hot or gloomy.\nMulch\nAfter the plant reaches a considerable height, you can mulch the area to help the soil retain moisture and prevent weed growth. If you witness heavy rain, refill the mulch.\nSupport\nIn case your area experience strong wind, you can provide some support to the plant, like bamboo or stake.\nFlowering time\nTwo to three months after planting, your sunflowers should begin to bloom in the middle of the summer.\nIndoor gardening\n\nBuy sunflower seeds online or offline. It would be best if you opted for the dwarf variety of sunflowers because you want to keep it indoors.\nYou also must be informed about the type of sunflower that will bloom in your indoor space. Single-stem sunflowers can grow from one seed. If you or any family member is allergic to pollen, you can choose this one because single-stem sunflowers are pollen-less. But if you want it to bloom through summer, you must replant it every two weeks. On the other hand, branching sunflowers will bloom all through the summer without replanting.\nNow you have to buy the correct size of container to grow sunflowers. As you are planting indoors, dwarf sunflowers can be planted in 12- to 16-cm containers.\nFor growing sunflowers, mix potting soil with compost to provide a nutrient-rich environment for the seeds.\nPress the seeds one inch deep into the soil. If you are planting multiple seeds, keep them 4 inches apart. After planting your seeds, top the soil with a thin layer of compost.\nAs they mature, sunflowers require more water than most other plants. Make sure the soil is always wet and has good drainage. While the seeds germinate, give your sunflowers at least 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water per week.\nYour sunflower seeds should begin to sprout into little seedlings in seven to ten days. Continue watering the seeds daily during this period, and ensure the soil is wet, especially around the seeds.\nFertilize if necessary and keep watering as the plant grows.\nAllow at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight to reach the plant daily.\nTwo to three months after planting, in the middle of the summer, your sunflowers should begin to blossom.\n\nHow to take care of sunflower plants\nThe sunflower is a garden jewel. Wherever you grow – be it a balcony, terrace, front yard garden, or by your window, make sure you fulfill the following care instructions: -\nSunlight\nFor strong stems and proper growth, sunflower plants must have 6–8 hours of daily sunlight. Sunlight exposure will help sunflowers stay straight rather than bend in the direction of the light's intensity since they are heliotropes (their flower heads follow the sun) by nature.\nLocation\nAs the name suggests, sunflowers are in love with the sun. So, any location that receives plenty of sunlight will be ideal for this flower.\nWater\nEven though sunflowers can withstand dry conditions, watering them regularly encourages blooming because flowering frequently declines during dry spells. Also, sunflowers require more water during germination, and after that, one inch per week is sufficient, but again, that will increase or decrease depending on the season and evapotranspiration rates. Wait for the top 2 inches of soil to dry out before watering. During the sultry summer season, if you notice your sunflowers drooping slightly, they likely need extra water.\nTemperature\nThe ideal temperature required for the growth of sunflowers is between 21 and 25 degrees Celsius. This is a hardy plant and can tolerate higher temperatures; ensure the water requirement is properly met in conjunction with the temperature. Sunflowers can also tolerate chilly weather if the sunlight is abundant.\nFertilizer\nAny fertilizer rich in phosphorus and potassium will work for the growth and development of sunflowers. If your soil is poor, opt for a slow-release fertilizer rich in potassium and phosphorus and apply it around the spring season. But if you have rich, loamy soil, you may not require any fertilizer.\nSoil\nAlthough sunflowers prefer slightly acidic to alkaline soil, they can grow in most soil types. This resilience or adaptability is one of the prime traits of a sunflower. The preferred soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.5. Sunflowers can grow beautifully in dry or poor soils, but the ideal soil would be well-draining with rich organic matter content.\nSunflowers will be a great addition to your balcony or backyard garden. They will brighten up your day with a cheerful vibe. It is easy to grow and maintain, so even if you are a beginner, you can raise a sunflower plant. This blog will guide you through the whole process.\nFAQs related to Sunflowers\nAre sunflowers low-maintenance plants?\nSunflowers are low-maintenance flowering plants and are very easy to grow.\nHow long does a cut sunflower stay fresh?\nA sunflower can remain fresh for a week to twelve days if it receives proper care, like clean water, every couple of days.\nHow long it takes sunflowers to bloom?\nFrom the time of sowing, it will take 80 to 120 days for sunflowers to bloom.\nWhich one is good – growing sunflowers in a pot or ground?\nYou can grow sunflowers both in pots and directly in the ground.

It can also help prevent hair fall and promote healthy hair.\n\nHow to grow tomatoes in your home\n\nTomatoes are one of the easiest vegetables that you can grow at home. Here is a complete guide to growing tomatoes at home: -\n\nThe first thing you need to do is choose a variety of tomato that you want to grow. There are broadly two types of tomatoes – bush and vine. If you opt for the vine variety, you need to build a cage, trellis, or stake, and you will get tomatoes all through the year. In this vine variety, you can opt for plum or cherry tomatoes, as they ripen quickly and produce more than the rest.\nGet tomato seeds and a seed starter mix to start the process of planting. Wet the seed starter mix and fill a seedling starter tray with this moist mix.\n\nPoke a hole in soil in each cell for 1/4th inch depth. Place 3 seeds in each hole with your fingers or tweezers. Cover up with moist soil or mix.\n\nAs you have planted the seeds, cover the seed tray with plastic wrap or a lid, because that will create a warm environment for the seeds to germinate and won’t let the soil dry out.\nMove the seed tray to a warm, sunny location where the temperature is between 21 and 27 degrees Celsius.\nCheck the seeds and soil every day and water accordingly. Remember to slightly moisten the soil and not make it soggy.\nThe seeds will germinate in 5 to 10 days.\nAs you see sprouts on the seeds, remove the cover and feed them with adequate light. Place it on a south facing window or keep the tray under a fluorescent light.\nWhen you see one to two sets of leaves appear, transplant the seedlings to a larger pot of five to ten gallons.\nRemove the seedlings gently and carefully, and bury them up to the little fuzzy hairs at the base of the plant. These fuzzy hairs will become roots.\nWater right after transplanting the seedling and keep an eye on the soil. Allow the soil to dry out before watering again.\nAfter two weeks of transplanting, feed the plant with nutrient rich fertilizer. Until the plant reaches maturity, apply fertilizer every two weeks.\nUse a stick, stake, cage, or trellis to offer support to the growing plant. Train your plant from this stage with whichever support you want to use. At this stage, take help of an experienced gardener or watch YouTube videos for the same.\nYou are growing the tomatoes indoors, and that means there won’t be bees or birds to help with pollination. You have to assist the plant in this pollination process. Direct a fan towards the plant, which will act like wind. Shake the main stem carefully with your hand so that pollen falls. Then use a paintbrush or cotton swab to rub these pollens on flowers.\n\nAfter your planting date, count 60-80 days for the tomato vine to produce fruit.\nHow to take care of tomato plants\nTomato plants are easy to care for. Just follow the instructions mentioned below and enjoy the tangy, red tomatoes.\nSunlight\nTomato plants are thirsty for sunlight. They require 6-8 hours of bright, direct sunlight daily. So, during the cold winter, you can arrange artificial lights to aid the growth and development of these plants.\nLocation\nA south-facing window would be the best location for your tomato plant at home. You can rotate the pot daily until the seedlings flower and produce fruits. If you reside in a warm or hot region, pick an area that receives shade in the late afternoon.\nWater\nTry to maintain moderately wet but not waterlogged soil. Tomato plants love water but cannot sustain themselves in soggy soil because that leads to damage. The plant can avoid splitting with consistent, thoughtful, and calculated watering. Always check for a one-inch depth of soil before watering. Water only an inch or two every week, but only when the soil dries.\nSoil\nTomatoes need soil that is organically rich, well-draining, and slightly acidic to neutral. The soil pH should be between 6.0 and 6.8. For indoor planting, opt for an all-purpose organic potting soil mix.\nFertilizer\nUse an organic slow-release fertilizer on your plants since tomatoes are heavy feeders. Tomato plants grown indoors typically require more fertilizer than those produced outside. To ensure greater production, you could need a high-phosphorus fertilizer. Additionally, keep in mind that the soil must be nutrient-rich for tomato plants to survive the entire growing season. Occasionally, you can add manure or compost.\nYour diet is incomplete without tomatoes. It will save you some extra bucks when you grow tomatoes inside your home, right? Moreover, the satisfaction of eating something homegrown is unparalleled. So, grow tomatoes in your home today –it’s pretty easy!\nFAQs related to Tomatoes\nIs it healthy to eat tomatoes every day?\nYes, eating tomatoes every day is a healthy habit. You may eat it in raw or cooked form. Almost all our regular Indian dishes, vegetarian or non-vegetarian, are incomplete without tomatoes. Your body will get essential vitamin C and antioxidants from tomatoes - no matter which form you consume them.\nWhich is the healthiest way to consume tomatoes – raw or cooked?\nEating tomatoes raw or cooked – is a debatable question. In one experiment conducted by Cornell University scientists, they roasted tomatoes and discovered that as cooking time increased, the vitamin C content of the tomatoes reduced. Compared to raw tomatoes, cooked tomatoes had 10% less vitamin C after 2 minutes of cooking and 29% less after 30 minutes. The lycopene concentration of the tomatoes, however, was the opposite. They had 54% more lycopene after only two minutes of cooking and 164% more after thirty. So, whichever way you consume tomatoes – it will be beneficial for you. You may bring a balance by eating raw tomatoes one day, followed by cooked tomatoes the next day.\nHow long will it take for my tomatoes to grow?\nFrom the planting day, tomato plants will take at least 60-100 days to harvest, depending on the variety, season, and care you provide.\nIs the tomato a perennial plant?\nTomatoes are grown as perennial plants in tropical countries like India, but elsewhere it is mainly grown annually.\nDo tomatoes love the sun or shade?\nTomatoes love the sun.

It also has potent antioxidants that can be used for overall well-being.\nThe beauty of this flower is unmatched. So, to make your home garden more interesting, you can learn plumeria growing tips from our blog. We will cover the following aspects in our blog:\n\nLovely facts about Plumeria flowers\nHow to grow plumeria at home\nHow to take care of plumeria flowering plants\nBenefits of plumeria flowers\n\nLet’s get started.\nLovely facts about Plumeria flowers\n\nThe refreshing and beautiful plumeria is a tropical flowering plant with more than 300 species worldwide.\nThese flowers are indigenous to Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America.\nThe 17th-century French botanist Charles Plumier, who traveled to the New World and documented several plant and animal species, is the inspiration behind the name plumeria.\nPlumeria is one of the most famous flowers in Karnataka. The bride and groom exchange cream-colored plumeria garlands at weddings in that state of India. The majority of temples in this state have this plant.\nContrary to how it is perceived in India, plumeria in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia, is often associated with cemeteries and is known as a “ghost flower.”\nWant to know something spooky? In Indonesia and Malaysia, folklore says that the scent of plumeria attracts Kuntilanak – an evil spirit of a dead mother.\nPlumeria is the national flower of Nicaragua and Laos\nIn many Asian countries, plumeria plants are found in temples, and that’s why sometimes they are referred to as “temple trees.”\n\nHow to grow plumeria at home\nPlumeria is a tropical and sub-tropical shrub or tree famous for its beautiful flowers. This flowering plant would require good care, and you have to be patient because it will take up to 3 years to bloom. It can be easily grown in your garden if you follow certain instructions mentioned below: -\nThe seed method\nBuy seeds online or offline\nThe first and foremost thing to do is buy seeds from a local nursery or online. Seeds can be harvested in the spring or fall, allowing propagation of the plumeria plant.\nSeed germination\nIn this step, you must place the seeds on a wet paper towel for 24 hours. It will allow the seeds to absorb enough moisture, and the seeds will swell up too. The seeds' swelling is substantial because it indicates that they are ready to grow. While germinating on a wet paper towel, ensure the environment is warm.\nPlant the seeds\nTake a well-draining medium-sized container and fill it with potting soil. Press the seeds into the soil at a depth of 5 mm. Make sure the swollen end of the seeds remains at the bottom. Use one seed for one pot or container. For your ease, you may plant them in a small pot of around 500 ml first, and after root development in a month, transplant them into a larger pot of 9.5 liters.\nTime to transplant\nOnce the seedlings reach a height of about 3 inches, you can transplant them into a larger pot. Carefully remove the seedling from its soil and place it in a larger pot filled with potting soil. Cover the roots with soil and tap the soil firmly.\nWater adequately\nRemember to water the plumeria at least once a week from March and April through November and December. You can cease watering it when the leaves begin to drop, and do not water it when it is dormant. Overwatering this plant can be hazardous, so allow the soil to dry out first.\nApply fertilizer\nDuring the blooming season of plumeria, i.e., May to November, you may add a high-phosphorus fertilizer twice a month. The NPK ratio of the fertilizer should be 10-30-10. You must dilute the fertilizer by mixing 1 or 2 tablespoons with one gallon of water. Remember not to fertilize the plant during its dormant time, i.e., the winter season.\nPrune if needed\nPruning is essential for better growth. If you see branches getting very long, prune them in late winter. Just cut the branches 1/3rd, which is enough to improve the plant's overall health.\nLook out for pests and insects\nMites, aphids, or flies can attack plumeria plants. Consult a local nursery or experienced gardener if you see horticultural oil or malathion insecticide application to leaves is not solving the problem.\nWinter care\nIf your region experiences cold waves and the temperature drops below 13 degrees Celsius, it is suggested that you move the plumeria pot inside for a warmer environment. They can survive even in low light during the winter season.\nRepotting\nIf your plumeria plant has outgrown the container, repot it in a larger pot.\nKeep taking care of the plumeria plant with patience. In three years, the plant will start blooming.\nThe stem-cutting method\nGet a stem-cutting\nThe stem-cutting should be taken in early summer or spring. The stem-cutting that you pick for your plant should be healthy, thick, and 12 inches long. Take a garden shear and look out for the branches that are dark brown or dark green, proving their maturity, and cut the stem. And before cutting, rub the garden shear with rubbing alcohol.\nRemove flowers and leaves\nThe stem you just cut must have lovely flowers and shiny leaves. You have to remove them; otherwise, the plant would concentrate more on sustaining the leaves and flowers than on new growth. Use sterilized scissors to remove the leaves and flowers from the stem-cutting.\nStore the stem-cutting\nYou must store the stem-cutting in a shady area for a couple of weeks. That’s because before you plant the stem, it should be scorched. Choose a warm and humid place for keeping the stem.\nPrepare the stem-cutting\n\nOnce the stem has dried and hardened, it is ready to be planted. You have to choose a large pot, and remember that the size of the pot will determine the growth of the plumeria. The pot can be 1 gallon or around 4 liters with suitable drainage holes.\nFill the pot with perlite and potting soil in a 2:1 ratio. While buying potting soil, pick up the one that says “fast-draining potting soil.\"\nTo give the cutting a proper medium to grow in and eliminate spillage when you water, fill the container 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the brim.\n\nWater\nWater the soil and make sure it exits from the drainage holes. If it doesn’t, you must add vermiculite to the soil to make it more porous.\nRoot hormone (optional)\nUse a root hormone powder to encourage the first roots to emerge from the stem cutting. Dip the end of your stem-cutting into a cup of water, and then cover it with root hormone powder to a depth of 1-2 inches.\nPlant the stem-cutting\nRight in the middle of the pot, insert the stem-cutting into the potting soil mix to a depth of 3–4 inches. Add an extra layer of potting soil to keep the stem in place. Also, pat the ground to prevent the cutting from shifting and staying firm.\nOffer support\nUse a stake to keep the stem-cutting upright in the pot if it's too big and tipping over. Put a stake deeply into the potting soil. The stake should then be secured to the stem-cutting with wire or string.\nRoot development\nYou have to keep the pot in a warm place with a temperature above 16 degrees Celsius for them to take root. A plumeria will take around 4–8 weeks to establish its roots.\nBasic care until blooming\n\nWater the plant one inch every week. Allow the soil to dry before watering, and avoid overwatering.\nEnsure the plumeria plant receives bright, direct sunlight for at least 8 hours daily.\nWhen winter approaches and the temperature drops below 13 degrees Celsius, bring it indoors.\nSpray fertilize the plant once every one-three weeks using a tropical plumeria plant fertilizer during the growing season.\nPrune when the leaves become more prominent and also keep a check on insects or pests.\n\nHave patience and take good care of your plumeria plant, which will bloom between one and three years.\nHow to take care of plumeria flowering plants\nTaking care of plumeria is not at all problematic. Just stick to the following instructions: -\nLocation\nA warm location is what plumerias want the most. Choosing the right site is essential because this plant won’t survive in temperatures below 13 degrees Celsius. So, in case your region experience cold weather, refrain from planting it outside or bring it inside when winter gets tough. Plumeria can be sustained in pots inside. Don’t worry if summer in your region is sweltering because plumeria is a hardy plant that can withstand temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius.\nSunlight\nEnsure adequate sunlight. Plumerias grow best in full sunlight, at least 6 hours a day. Find a location where the tree will be exposed to regular sunlight. Plumerias grow well in greenhouses or near a big window with lots of light if you grow them inside.\nTemperature\nThe ideal temperature for the growth of plumerias is between 18 and 27 degrees Celsius.\nSoil\nAs long as the soil is well-draining, the plumeria plant can grow in various soil types. Root rot can be brought on by poor drainage in the ground. It thrives on neutral or slightly acidic, loamy, rich, well-draining soil.\nFertilizer\nOpt for a high-phosphorus fertilizer once a month during the growing season. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers would give rise to more foliage and not blooms—remember that while feeding your plant. Also, if the plant is established, it may not require additional fertilizer.\nWater\nAbout one inch of water each week is sufficient for these trees. Water deeply and wait until the soil is parched before watering again. Do not water outdoor frangipanis when they are dormant. During their dormancy, indoor plumerias require watering roughly every two or three weeks. Established plants can withstand drought.\nBenefits of plumeria flowers\nBesides imparting beauty to your garden and indoor space, this flower also has other uses. One of the significant uses of plumeria flowers is in the making of essential oil, which has many benefits as mentioned below: -\n\nThe deep cleansing properties of frangipani oil help clear impurities and dirt from within your skin and unclog pores.\nThis essential oil is hugely used in aromatherapy for its seductive and energizing scent that strengthens the mind and body.\nThis essential oil's anti-inflammatory nature helps make your skin blemish- and spot-free.\nPlumeria oil is well known for reducing tinnitus, back pain, headaches, and inflammation.\nThe frangipani flower has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help to improve general health.\nRich in antioxidants, plumeria oil improves skin health by removing harmful pollutants and free radicals that might otherwise oxidize good skin cells.\nThe astringent property in frangipani essential oil is beneficial for preventing dandruff, hydrating the scalp, protecting the hair from UV damage, and strengthening hair follicles.\nThis plumeria oil has soothing properties, too, that may help people with sleeping disorders.\nLike many other essential oils, plumeria essential oil may help relieve stress.\n\nThere is no denying the fact that plumeria is a jewel of a garden. The bright, shiny, and long leaves, coupled with a gorgeous bloom, can erase all your worries and fill your mind with joy. Bring this plant home and care for it to transform your garden.\nFAQs related to Plumeria Flowers\nWhat is plumeria known as in Hindi?\nPlumeria is known as gulchin or champa in Hindi.\nCan I grow plumeria in pots?\nYes, plumeria can be easily grown in pots. Opt for a 500-ml pot while starting, and then use a larger pot when the roots establish themselves.\nIs plumeria a summer or winter flower?\nPlumeria is a summer flower.

Research says that it can help with weight loss, aid digestion, and build stronger bones.\nThat’s not all!\nThis bushy plant is an excellent source of bioactive substances such as arginine aspartic acids, alkaloids, and flavonoids. It is thus known as the father of modern medicine.\nThis blog will inform you about how to grow a brinjal plant at home. We will talk about the following: -\n\nInteresting facts about Brinjal\nHow to grow brinjal at home\nHow to take care of brinjal plants\nHealth benefits of brinjal\n\nSo, continue reading the blog to learn more about growing brinjal.\nInteresting facts about brinjal\n\nBrinjal is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae.\nAlthough there is not enough evidence, it is widely accepted that brinjals are native to India. It grows wildly in Africa and South Asia, though.\nAccording to botany, brinjal is a berry.\nBelonging to the genus Solanum, brinjal is related to tomatoes, chili peppers, and potatoes.\nOver 80% of brinjal produced globally comes from China and India. China produced 65% and India produced 23% of the world's brinjal in 2020.\nBrinjals are a rich source of fiber, potassium, and anthocyanins\nAnthocyanins in brinjal are responsible for that purple hue\nBrinjal has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties\n\nHow to grow brinjal at home\n\nGet a plastic gardening tray if you're growing your eggplants from seed. For every two seeds, you need one pot. It might be simpler to move your seedlings into larger pots later if you use seedling trays and other inexpensive plastic containers.\nAs brinjals like heat, you can bring clay pots for further use. Opt for the unglazed ones because they retain water longer. Also, check for proper drainage holes.\nPrepare your soil now. One part sand and two parts potting soil are ideal. Also, use 20-20-20 NPK fertilizer, which you must reapply every 10–12 weeks.\nAlso, buy a tomato cage or teepee stake to offer optimum support to brinjal plants.\nSow the seeds indoors around April. Take the gardening tray and put the potting mix into your tiny pots or trays.\nMake a hole in the middle of each pot or tray portion measuring 1/2 inch.\nThe likelihood of at least one seed sprouting increases when two seeds are planted. So, put two seeds in that hole.\nNow, cover the seeds lightly with additional potting mix\nPlace the tray in a bright and sunny spot where it can receive at least 8 hours of direct sunlight\nAlways keep the soil just damp enough to touch, but avoid overwatering\nOnce your seedlings have two sets of leaves, thin them out. Keep the stronger of the two seedlings in each tray section and cut the weaker one to the soil line.\nWhen the seedlings reach half a foot in height, you have to transplant them into bigger pots.\nNow, set up your staking system in the bigger pot. Position the stake straight up and down, with the foot of the stake or tomato cage flat on the bottom of the pot.\nFill the pot with potting soil that you have prepared. Keep a gap of 1 inch between the lip of the pot and the top of the soil.\nDig a hole in the middle to put the seedling. Gently lift the string seedling from the tray and carefully place it in the new pot.\nUse some potting mix to help keep the seedling in place, and then water them.\nPlace the pot in a sunny spot, water regularly after checking the soil's condition, and look out for pests.\nAs the plant starts to flower, switch to a 9-15-30 NPK fertilizer for better growth and yield.\nContinue caring for the plant, and in 100-130 days, the vegetables will be ready for harvest.\n\nHow to take care of brinjal plants\nSunlight\nBrinjal is a sun-loving plant. Allow this plant at least six hours of direct sunlight a day for appropriate growth and production.\nLocation\nIf planting indoors, select a window that receives six-eight hours of bright light. If placing outdoors, choose the sunniest spot in your garden.\nWater\nBrinjal plants love moist soil because that aids in their development. But remember a soggy soil will harm the plant. So, water this plant frequently, but always check the soil first. o protect the soil and aid in moisture retention, it is a good idea to cover it with some sort of mulch, such as straw or wood chips.\nSoil\nThe soil for brinjal plants should be well-draining and rich in organic matter. For outdoor gardening, choosing a sandy loam soil to which you can add organic matter before planting the seeds is great. To grow brinjal plants in pots indoors, you can take two parts of potting soil and one part of sand to balance drainage and nutrient. The soil pH should be between 5.5 and 6.6.\nDo you know that brinjal plants raised on sandy soils produce early, whereas those raised in clayey soils produce more?\nTemperature\nBrinjal is a warm season crop, and that’s why, it will require a lengthy, warm growth season. Remember that it is extremely vulnerable to freezing. The ideal temperature range for its optimal production is 13–21 degrees Celsius on a daily average. When the temperature drops below 17 degrees Celsius, it has a significant negative impact on the crop's growth. It can be grown effectively both during the rainy and summer seasons.\nFertilizer\nA fertilizer with NPK 20-20-20 is best for brinjal plants.\nSpacing\nPlants should be placed in rows that are at least three feet apart and at least two feet apart. While nursery plants should be placed at the same depth that they were growing in their nursery container, seeds should be covered with around 1/4th inch of soil.\nSupport\nBrinjal has weak stems, which is why it would require support to stand up. Add stakes while the plant is young and small so that the roots are not disturbed later. The majority of kinds can be safely attached to a piece of bamboo or a wooden stake that has been buried a few inches deep in the ground away from the plant. A tomato cage made of coated metal or one made of bamboo are other options.\nHealth benefits of brinjal\nBrinjals are renowned for having an incredibly soft texture and are slightly slimy when cooked. In addition to being delicious, they have a good amount of antioxidants and essential nutrients. So, you should never skip it. The nutritional value and health benefits of brinjal are listed below: -\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrates\n\n\n6gm\n\n\n\n\nFat\n\n\n0.2gm\n\n\n\n\nIron\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\nMagnesium\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n\n\n229mg\n\n\n\n\nVitamin B6\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n1g\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n\n\n2mg\n\n\n\n\n  \nMay fight cancer\nSeveral chemicals found in eggplant have been shown to have anti-cancer effects. Solasodine rhamnosyl glycosides (SRGs), mainly, are a chemical present in some nightshade vegetables, such as eggplant. SRGs may kill cancer cells, according to certain animal studies, and they may also lessen the likelihood that some cancers will return. The polyphenols present in brinjal also show anti-cancer effects. Another notable thing is that eggplants or brinjal are rich in Vitamin C and promote white blood cells, which are our body's main line of defense.\nMay help in weight loss\nIf you want to lose weight, you can include eggplant in your diet. No cholesterol, fat, or very few calories are found in eggplant. Consuming eggplant, which is high in fiber, prevents ghrelin from being released into the body. This hormone plays a crucial role in making us feel hungry once more. The fiber makes us feel full and lowers our risk of overeating.\nTakes care of the heart\nBecause it includes potassium, vitamin C, vitamin B6, and phytonutrients, eggplant generally benefits heart health. By consuming more good cholesterol (HDL) and less bad cholesterol, eggplant aids in the maintenance of our body's cholesterol levels (LDL). If our LDL levels are decreased, the risks of heart attacks, strokes, and atherosclerosis are significantly reduced. Additionally, eggplant has the ability to control blood pressure, which lessens the stress and strain on our cardiovascular system. This promotes the health of our hearts.\nStrengthens bones\nBrinjal is rich in copper and Vitamin K, which means it can strengthen bones, increase mineral density, and prevent osteoporosis. This vegetable contains collagen, which aids in the development of bones and connective tissue. The presence of potassium in brinjal will not only make your bones healthier but also help them absorb calcium.\nGood for digestion\nBrinjals have a low amount of fat and cholesterol and more dietary fiber. This fiber helps with good bowel movements by giving our stools more volume and efficiently removing waste from our bodies. Also, this fiber enhances the secretion of gastric juice, which is essential for the digestion of food and absorbing nutrients.\nControl diabetes\nBecause they are high in fiber and low in soluble carbohydrates, brinjals are beneficial for treating diabetes. The vegetable brinjal helps the body control the activity of insulin and glucose. The harmful effects of diabetes on our bodies can be avoided with the aid of stable insulin levels. Brinjal falls in the list of \"foods with the low glycemic index,\" and its GI is 15 (foods falling between 0 and 50 are called low GI).\nPromotes brain health\nThe presence of phytonutrients makes brinjal an excellent choice for improving brain health. Phytonutrients are renowned for increasing cognitive abilities and removing free radicals that may cause diseases. Thus our brain is guarded with these nutrients. Our brain receives more oxygen-rich blood when eggplant or brinjal are consumed, supporting neural network growth. This enhances our memory and capacity for critical thought.\nWith such nutritional value and ease of gardening, who wouldn’t want to grow brinjal plants at home? Take notes from this blog and get started. It is going to be a rewarding experience—trust us!\nFAQs Related to Brinjal\nWhy is brinjal sometimes called eggplant?\nThe white variety of brinjal resembled eggs, and the Europeans thus named it eggplant back in the 1700s.\nHow long it takes brinjals to grow?\nIt takes at least 100-120 days for brinjals to mature.\nWhich season is best for growing brinjal?\nBrinjals can be grown as both summer and winter season crops.

Here is what we will cover: -\n\nInteresting facts about lemons\nHow to grow lemons at home\nHow to take care of lemon tree\nHealth benefits of lemon\n\nSo, let’s get started.\nInteresting facts about lemons\n\nIn the flowering plant family Rutaceae, the lemon is a species of small evergreen trees indigenous to Asia, particularly Northeast India (Assam), Northern Myanmar, and China.\nLemons entered Europe in 200 AD in southern Italy, and it was not before 700 AD that people in Oran and Egypt started planting them.\nDid you know it was Christopher Columbus who brought lemon seeds to America? Lemon was introduced to America in 1493.\nOn average, a lemon tree, if provided with regular care, can live up to 50 years.\nA large lemon tree can produce at least 1000 lemons annually, around 226 kg approximately.\nA great tip from a chef – you may keep various fruits from rotting and becoming brown by spraying them with a few drops of lemon juice.\nYou would be surprised to know that something called \"lemon festival\" or \"Fête du Citron\" is held annually in Menton, France. This event honors Menton's yearly production of premium lemons and other citrus produce. The carnival's floats and sculptures are all made entirely from lemons and oranges.\n\nHow to grow lemons at home\nLemon trees are evergreen citruses that produce sour, yellow fruits and have a lovely scent. Although lemon trees thrive outside, they can also be planted indoors with the proper care. Here is a guide to how you can grow lemons at home.\n\nGo to a local nursery and check for the most adaptable lemon tree that will grow inside without much problem. Also, ask the nursery expert about the tree's expected production of lemons, and based on that, buy a tree. Please get a lemon tree that is 2-3 years old.\nYou can also grow lemon trees from seeds you discard after use, but they may not adapt to the indoor environment.\nNow buy a deep and large plastic pot to grow your lemon tree. The depth should be good because that will help the tree develop a robust root system and support. Also, the depth of the pot will further determine how long the tree can grow. The recommended size is 15 gallons, or 57 liters.\nPlastic would be the preferred material because it is light and you can move them easily.\nAlso, check for drainage holes in the pot because lemon trees won't survive in soggy conditions.\nYou have to keep a saucer under the plant pot. Find a few pebbles or gravel to spread over the saucer and sprinkle some water on it. The saucer with water will help keep the damp air surrounding your tree.\nLemon trees require slightly acidic soil. So, you can bring a well-draining acidic potting mix or mix some peat moss into regular soil.\nDedicate a sunny spot in your home, balcony, or terrace to a lemon tree. They require 8-12 hours of direct sunlight to flourish properly. You can pick a spot next to a window. Set up a grow light near the plant and leave it on for up to 12 hours a day if you live in a place with little sunlight.\nBefore putting your lemon tree in the pot, pour roughly half of the soil mixture and pat it nicely.\nYou must now pull the plant from the nursery pot you bought to keep it in the new pot. Be careful and do not rupture any roots. With your hands, gently pull the roots apart while massaging them with your fingers. This will enable the roots to swell more quickly and absorb more water and nutrients from the soil.\nAfter setting it upright in the pot, add soil to the remaining space. Make sure that no roots are left exposed or out of the soil. So, gently press the soil down around the plant's base. Just remember to plant the tree at the same depth as in the previous pot. Also, avoid putting soil on the trunk because doing so might lead to fungus diseases.\nNow, water the plant adequately. As your plant adapts, moistening the soil will help make it more hospitable. Water the tree just enough so the soil is wet but not soggy.\nEnsure good air circulation around the lemon tree. In warm weather, open a door or window close to your plant to simulate outdoor conditions. Install a revolving fan next to the lemon tree if the air is too chilly to keep it well-ventilated.\nLemon trees will require fertilizer every month. Opt for a nitrogen-rich fertilizer.\nPrune out sick, dead, and broken branches and thin the tree to manage its height and spread. This can be done once a year.\nThe plant's stamens and anthers, the pollen-covered buds in the center of the flower, should be rubbed with the paintbrush. Put the pollen on the pistil, the bulb that is buried deep inside the flower.\nTo guarantee pollination, repeat this procedure once daily. Lemons generally harvest in 6 to 9 months following good pollination. The tree will produce fruits even when you don't pollinate, but the fruits will be bigger if you pollinate.\n\nHow to take care of a lemon tree\nOne of the basic requirements for growing a lemon tree is a tropical or sub-tropical climate, making India a great place to produce them. Just follow the care instructions given below and grow lemons without any hassle.\nSunlight\nLemon trees grow best under full sun. Ensure the tree receives at least 8 hours of sunlight daily.\nLocation\nAs lemon trees love the sun, choose a sunny spot in your garden, terrace, or balcony. But remember that lemon trees need protection against strong winds. In that case, you can place it on the southwest side of your house along a wall to protect it against the wind.\nTemperature\nThe ideal temperature for lemon trees would be between 23 and 18 degrees Celsius.\nFertilizer\nLemon trees require a lot of energy, as other citrus fruit trees do. Use an 8-8-8 NPK fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) to promote fruit output and healthy growth.\nSoil\nLemon trees like slightly acidic soil, so the pH should be between 5.7 and 6.5. A well-draining loamy soil is suitable for the cultivation of lemons.\nWater\nA successful harvest depends on understanding your lemon tree's watering needs. More frequent watering will be necessary throughout the establishing phase, sometimes even once or twice per week. Lemon trees become increasingly drought resistant as they age. The soil needs to be moist during the summer, especially for young trees. Be careful to avoid creating waterlogging because soggy situations are dangerous.\nHealth benefits of lemon\nLemon is an essential fruit in all our households. From squeezing on our salad bowls to our chicken recipes, lemon adds uniqueness. Besides culinary purposes, lemons have been in use since time immemorial for a variety of medical purposes too. Note the nutritional value of half cup of lemon and the general health benefits of lemons below: -\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrates\n\n\n10gm\n\n\n\n\nFat\n\n\n0gm\n\n\n\n\nFiber\n\n\n3gm\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n1gm\n\n\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n3gm\n\n\n\n\nGood friend to your heart\nLemons are one of the richest sources of vitamin C.

The citric acid in lemons may help prevent kidney stones by raising the volume and pH of the urine and reducing the conditions that encourage kidney stone formation.\nHelps in losing weight\nA popular health drink believed to help people lose weight is – one whole lemon in a glass of lukewarm water with a tablespoon of honey. Pectin, a type of fiber in lemon, expands after ingestion and makes one feel fuller for a long time. As you stop snacking or overeating, your weight is controlled.\nGood for oral health\nLemons can promote oral health because of their content of vitamin C. They take good care of teeth and gums. Scurvy is a condition resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C, leading to swollen and bleeding gums. Lemon is a powerful remedy for such diseases. Lemon juice can also relieve toothaches.\nGlowing skin\nVitamin C is required to produce collagen, giving skin a youthful glow and plumpness. Lemons bring that glow back to your skin.

For its sturdiness, it is often used in the manufacture of furniture.\n\nHow to grow cherry at home\nCherry trees are sensitive and require a gardener's patience to grow and bear fruit. If you are bringing this tree home, be ready to invest your time. Follow the steps mentioned below to grow a cherry tree at home: -\nPick the type of cherry\nPick a variety of cherries first, depending on the climate to which you belong. Ask an experienced nursery owner, a gardener, or a gardener or farmer, and then go ahead. There are broadly two types of cherries – sweet and sour. Then there are more varieties under them. Sweet cherries generally require a dry climate that is not too hot and well-drained soil. On the other hand, sour or tart cherries also need well-drained soil, but they can tolerate higher temperatures with more rain and greater humidity.\nPick the type of tree\nAfter this, you must decide whether you want a standard or dwarf-sized tree. Remember that standard-sized trees are more resilient, have a longer life, and produce more cherries. On the other hand, dwarf trees are petite, take up less space, and produce fruit at a tender age of 2-3 years.\nTime to sow\nThe best time to plant this tree is in the fall, since it will have time to adapt and build a sturdy root system to withstand the upcoming colder months. If planted in the fall, both sweet and tart cherries grow the healthiest. During the spring, summer, and fall, if you choose to plant your cherry tree in the spring, make sure to give it enough water.\nSoil preparation\nIn this stage, remove weeds from the soil, and mix well-rotted compost or manure to fertilize your garden soil. Make sure the soil is well-draining by building raised soil beds or adding more organic matter.\nCheck the soil pH, which should be between 6.0 and 7.5. So, add lime to reduce acidity or add sulfur to increase acidity, depending on the measured pH of your soil.\nGet young tree\nPurchase a cherry tree whose branches are between 2 inches (5.1 cm) and 8 inches (20 cm) in size.\nChoose a spot\nBoth sweet and tart cherries would require full sunlight to develop appropriately, but tart cherries may grow with less sun than sweet cherries. You can place your trees on slopes that receive morning sun. But don't place your cherries close to other trees or structures that provide shade.\nSpacing\nTrees planted too closely together will compete with one another for soil nutrients and sunlight. For sweet cherries, place adult trees 35–40 feet (11–12 m) apart and dwarf trees 5–10 feet (1.5–3.0 m) apart. Space dwarf trees for tart cherry 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) apart, and adult trees 20–25 feet apart (6.1–7.6 m)\nPlace the tree\nInspect the size of the tree root first, and then dig a hole twice its size to place the tree. It will help the tree develop its roots. Now carefully lift the tree you bought and put it in this hole.\nCover with soil\nUsing the soil mix, you prepared to fill in the hole to the original soil mark on the tree. To get rid of any air pockets as you fill the hole, keep firmly pressing the soil down.\nProvide support\nTake tree stakes or ties and place them about 1/3rd the height of the tree and insert them into the soil to provide support to the young tree.\nWater\nNow you must water the tree well by turning on your hose with only partial power, which is called the \"slow trickle\" method. Leave the hose there for a couple of hours, and then turn off the water.\nMulch\nLater in the winter, add a new layer of mulch to the soil to help it retain moisture.\nOver the next four years, take routine care of your tree as you wait for the fruit to develop. Cherries develop and mature over time. Your cherry trees should produce 30 to 50 quarts of cherries after around four years. Until then, give your tree frequent watering, trimming, and fertilization to ensure its health and strength.\nThe seed method\nSave some seeds after you have eaten your favorite cherries to grow your tree at home. Follow the steps mentioned below and go ahead.\n\nThere are two times to prepare your cherry tree: one, to prepare and plant them in the spring, and second, to plant them in the fall.\nTake the seeds, put them in warm water, let them soak for a few minutes, and then clean them to remove any traces of pulp.\nTake a clean paper towel, spread the seeds, and let them dry for five days. To accentuate proper drying, put the seeds in a warm area, like a window that receives enough sunlight.\nAfter five days, put the dry seeds in a glass jar or plastic container, close the lid, and refrigerate for ten weeks. This process is known as stratification, which augments the germination of the seeds.\nAs ten weeks pass, remove the cherry seeds from the refrigerator and allow them some hours to return to average room temperature.\nTake small to medium-sized plant pots and fill them with potting soil to keep these seeds. Put two to three seeds in each pot.\nLook for a sunny spot and keep the pots there. Make sure you provide enough water to keep the soil just moist and not soggy.\nWhen the seedlings reach a height of 2 inches, look out for the thinner and weaker ones and cut them off.\nKeep them in a sunny spot, and at night if it gets cold, bring the post inside.\nThe seedlings will become taller by spring, like 10-12 inches. Now you can plant them outside 20 feet apart from each other.\n\nTake proper care of them until they bear fruit.\nCare guide for cherry tree at home\nIt would be best if you took good care of the cherry tree throughout the year, from mulching to fertilizing. Here are some of the significant points that you must remember.\nSoil\nThe deep sandy loam soil with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5 is necessary for cherry trees. A well-draining soil with good water retention capacity is ideal for cherries. That's because cherry trees are delicate to stagnation.\nWater\nThe water requirement of cherry trees would vary according to their age. For a young cherry tree in its first year, 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) of water every one to two weeks is enough. When the tree matures or completes a year, you can water it with just an inch (2.5 cm) of water every one to two weeks. Remember that cherry trees love moist soil, but soggy soil would welcome diseases. So, check the top one to two inches of soil before watering. Also, remember that cherry trees require more water in the spring and summer.\nFertilizer\nThe cherry tree is not much of a feeder. You should add compost and manure to the soil bed before sowing seeds. A low-nitrogen fertilizer during early spring would be best if you want to enhance fruit production. But again, if your tree isn't producing enough fruits considering its age, then fertilize it; otherwise, don't.\nSunlight\nIdeally, full sunlight for 6–8 hours is necessary for the remarkable growth of cherry trees.\nLocation\nChoose a sunny spot in your garden, and remember, wherever you plant a cheery tree, the area should not have any more giant trees or buildings; otherwise, the shade would disturb its growth.\nPruning\nCherry trees require annual pruning in late winter, when the fruits are almost over. Use scissors or pruners to cut off dead, damaged, or diseased branches and leaves. This will promote the growth of new fruiting trees.\nWinter care\nThose places with heavy winter seasons can wrap the trunk of the cherry tree to prevent winter sunscald.\nPesticides\nPests like aphids, caterpillars, and Japanese beetles often get attracted to cherry trees. Opt for a natural pesticide to get rid of these pests. Look out for tutorial videos on how to prepare your homemade pesticide and stay away from harsh chemical ones.\nGuarding the fruits\nIt's necessary to cover your cherry tree with a net, as that will protect the fruits from birds. Sweet or tart cherries are always the top favorites of the flying buddies. Offer them some, but if you also want to savor the fruits, kindly block them with a net. So, every year before harvest, check your net to see if it needs to be replaced, and cover the tree beforehand because sometimes the birds attack even the buds.\nHealth benefits of cherries\nCherry is one of the best-looking fruits, isn't it? Besides good looks and great taste, it also has significant health benefits. Here is the nutritional chart for 100 grams of cherries: -\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrate\n\n\n16 g\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n\n\n13 mg\n\n\n\n\nCopper            \n\n\n0.06 mg\n\n\n\n\nEnergy\n\n\n63 kcal\n\n\n\n\nFiber\n\n\n2.1 g\n\n\n\n\nIron     \n\n\n0.36 mg\n\n\n\n\nMagnesium     \n\n\n11 mg\n\n\n\n\nManganese     \n\n\n0.07 mg\n\n\n\n\nPhosphorus     \n\n\n21 mg\n\n\n\n\nPotassium      \n\n\n222 mg\n\n\n\n\nProtein            \n\n\n1.06 g\n\n\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n12.8 g\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C        \n\n\n7 mg\n\n\n\n\nVitamin E        \n\n\n0.07 mg\n\n\n\n\nVitamin K        \n\n\n2.1 mg\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n\n\n3 mg\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n\n\n173 mg\n\n\n\n\n \nIf consumed in a moderate amount, you can, of course, benefit from cherries.

Peas provide a fair quantity of heart-healthy minerals like magnesium, potassium, and calcium, which help decrease blood pressure. High intakes of these minerals may be beneficial for lowering blood pressure, a significant risk factor for heart disease.

They also protect against heart-related diseases and even cancer. Peas are a great source of antioxidants like coumestrol. They also have a high amount of vitamin C, which is another potent antioxidant that gives your body stronger immunity.\nHow to grow peas at home easily\nPeas are very easy to grow, but their growing period is very limited. They can also be grown as a fall or winter crop in warmer regions. Here is a step-by-step guide to cultivating peas at home or in your garden.\nDirect in garden soil\nRight season to grow\nThe right time to sow peas in India is between October and November if you stay in the plainland. If you reside in the hills, the right time would be from the middle of March to the end of May.\nSoil preparation\nLightly moisten the soil, and then, using a hoe or spade, till the soil to a depth of 8–10 inches. Apply compost or no-nitrogen fertilizer and then check the soil pH. Depending on the soil pH, use sulfur or lime to increase or decrease the acidity of the soil. The ideal soil pH for peas is between 6.0 and 6.5. Also, check if the soil is well-draining or not. If not, add some sand to it.\nPot or garden\nPeas do best when directly sown into the ground since they dislike having their roots disturbed. However, if you sow your seeds in biodegradable containers, you can transplant them into the garden, where they will decompose. In places where the spring season is long and moist, you can plant peas in raised soil beds.\nGermination\nTo hasten the process of germination, you can soak the seeds in water overnight.\nSowing\nYou have to sow the seeds one inch deep into the soil, and the spacing between the seeds should be 2 inches. If you are planting in rows, then the spacing should be 7 inches.\nFertilizer\nYou may add no-nitrogen fertilizer that is rich only in potassium and phosphorus because pea plants already get enough nitrogen from the air. So, an excess of nitrogen will only enhance the foliage but degrade the quality of the vegetable.\nPlant support\nAs the plant grows, you have to provide it with support. Either get tree branches, pea sticks, or chicken wire, or build a trellis or spread a net to help it grow. It has to be done before the plants establish shallow roots.\nMoisture\nGive the soil enough water to keep it moist. If you see the seeds washing out of the soil, push them back into it. To avoid diseases, water should be added at a rate of one inch per week.\nHarvest\nIn about 60–70 days, you will see the peas mature. The rate of growth or maturing in peas is quite fast, so you should check the plant after the blooms appear. When the pods become plump and glossy, that’s the right time to harvest peas.\nPeas in a container or pot\n\nTake a large garden container or pot that is 8 to 18 inches deep and cover the drainage holes with a coffee filter.\nFill this pot with potting soil. Now, remember to infuse no-nitrogen fertilizer into this soil if it doesn’t already have any. After filling up the pot, smooth out the soil.\nEven though it's not required, feeding your pea seeds with legume inoculants will result in healthier plants and a greater crop of peas. You can soak your seeds in water for the entire night to hasten germination. Shake them in a bag with the inoculants while they are still wet.\nDepending on the surface area of the container, the number of peas would vary. Peas should be spaced at least 1 inch apart, and in a single spot, you can plant two seeds to augment germination.\nPress the seeds into the soil and cover them with 2 inches of soil. Water deeply, and then wait for the peas to sprout.\nIf you see more than one seed sprouting in the same spot, just pull out the weaker shoot\nAs most of the peas are climbers, you now have to prepare trellises to provide them with support. Now wait for some time for the peas to ripen before harvesting.\nExactly 60–70 days after sowing, these plants would be ready for harvest.\n\nHow to take care of pea plants at home\nPeas produce a surprisingly significant harvest for a small amount of work, grow quickly, and require minimal care. So, if you enjoy peas on your plate, just take care of the plants and enjoy your happy meals.\nWater\nOne of the most crucial elements of a successful pea harvest is proper watering. Never allow the soil to completely dry out, but also avoid letting it become too wet. Every week, about an inch of water should be enough.\nSoil\nAll peas need is well-draining soil. There are no other soil specifications for growing peas. So, make sure your garden soil or potting soil has sand or other materials that will facilitate good drainage. Apart from the type of soil, the other important factor in this segment is soil pH. Peas thrive in slightly acidic soil. The ideal soil pH should be between 6.0 and 6.5. Therefore, test your soil pH first and then add lime or sulphur to decrease or increase acidity, respectively.\nTemperature\nAlthough they can tolerate frigid conditions well, peas thrive in moderate temperatures between 15 degrees Celsius and 21 degrees Celsius. The plants will suffer once the temperature rises above 29 degrees Celsius.\nSunlight\nFor peas, a bright light source for 6–8 hours works well. They can also tolerate shade or partial shade, but that may affect the production and quality.\nLocation\nChoose a sun-facing spot in your terrace, balcony, or garden to grow this plant.\nFertilizer\nGenerally, peas don’t require fertilizer. This plant absorbs a lot of nitrogen from the air, so if you want to feed it, use fertilisers that are only 10% phosphorus and 10% potassium. While preparing the soil prior to sowing, you can mix compost into it that will look after the overall growth and production of peas.\nPeas are easily available in grocery stores, but nothing can match the taste of garden-fresh peas, right? And see, it is not too difficult to raise peas in your home or garden. Just follow the aforementioned steps and maintain the care instructions to relish the round green peas all through the winter season in your dishes.\nFAQs related to peas\nHow long does a pea plant take to grow?\nPeas take hardly 60 days to grow from the day of sowing.\nDo peas require full sunlight?\nYes, peas require 6–8 hours of full sunlight to grow.\nWhich fertilizer is best suited for the growth of peas?\nGenerally, the pea plant doesn’t require fertilizer for growth. For container plants, a moderate amount of fertilizer is still required. You may opt for 0-10-10 fertilizer which means 10% phosphorus, 10% potassium, and no amount of nitrogen. That’s because this plant can absorb enough nitrogen from the air.\nWill peas grow well in hot weather?\nNo, peas will not grow in hot weather. If you live in a hot and humid place, try to sow it long before summer arrives so that you can enjoy peas during the winter season.\nDo peas require daily watering?\nIf you are growing peas in a container, they will require more water than those that are directly sown into the soil in your garden. The topsoil should never be dry. Peas love moist and cool soil. But also remember that if you overwater, it will welcome diseases to this plant.\nIs the pea plant a climber?\nBoth low-growing and vining varieties of peas exist. The climbing varieties, which can reach heights of 1 to 2 meters, produce thin tendrils from their leaves that coil around any accessible support. So, in that sense, yes, a pea is a climber or creeper plant.",

That's what makes cauliflower healthier than its cousin.\nA cold-weather vegetable, cauliflower is enjoyed most in the winter months. Who doesn't love a plate of hot gobhi parantha (cauliflower flatbread) in the morning?\nIn this blog, we will talk about growing cauliflower at home. We will cover the following: -\n\nUnknown facts about cauliflower\nHow to grow cauliflower in your garden\nHow to take care of cauliflower plants\nMajor health benefits of cauliflower\n\nSo, let's enter the tasty world of cauliflower. \nUnknown facts about cauliflower\n\nCauliflower is one of several vegetables in the species Brassica oleracea in the genus Brassica, which is in the Brassicaceae (or mustard) family.\nCauliflower shares a family with kale, turnips, radish, and cabbage.\nChina is the largest producer of cauliflowers in the world, followed by India. In 2020, these countries produced 72% of the total world production of cauliflowers.\nPeople are becoming increasingly aware of and interested in a gluten-free diet due to numerous studies in the health and medical fields. Cauliflower is precisely what they were looking for! It is low-calorie and gluten-free.\nA new gluten-free rice known as \"cauliflower rice\" is becoming popular as a replacement for conventional white rice. Cauliflower florets are pulsed to create it, and the finished product is cooked in oil.\nCauliflower flour is also being made, and it is even used to create a pizza base.\nThe stems and leaves of cauliflower, which most people discard, are also nutritious and edible. They contain calcium, iron, fiber, vitamin C, and folate. In some parts of India, like West Bengal, these leaves and stems are consumed.\n\nHow to grow cauliflower in your garden\nCauliflower is not an easy vegetable to grow. You have to be careful and patient with it, but when your kitchen smells of various cauliflower dishes in the winter season, all your efforts will be worthwhile. This blog aims to provide you with simple techniques to grow cauliflower in your garden. Read below and learn how to grow cauliflower: -\nTime to plant\nThe ideal time to plant a cauliflower would be different for different climate zones. This vegetable requires cool weather for about three months to mature appropriately. The daytime temperature should not be more than 15 degrees Celsius when cauliflower is developing. For India, the ideal time to sow seeds would be late autumn (October or November), when the temperature drops below 27 degrees Celsius.\nMark your spot\nThe chosen spot in your garden should receive at least 6 hours of full sunlight. A cool temperature is essential, but bright and direct sunlight is equally important. There shouldn’t be any big trees, tall grass, or other crops around this location. The cauliflower plants have to be spaced 18-24 inches apart.\nPrepare your soil bed\nThe ideal soil for cauliflower plants should be fertile and water-retentive. Cauliflower plants require a constant supply of nutrients and moisture from the ground. That’s why you must apply high levels of organic matter to your garden soil to enhance the soil’s water-retentive ability. Also, use a potassium and nitrogen-rich fertilizer in the ground for your cauliflowers to be significant in size. After you have worked to make the soil nutrient-rich and more moisture-retentive, you have to check the soil pH. The optimal soil pH should be between 6.5 and 7.0. So, add lime or sulfur to reduce or increase soil acidity, respectively.\nPrepare seeds\nCauliflower is a fragile plant, so it is suggested to start with seedlings inside, and later, you can transplant it outside. Get biodegradable pots or cups, fill them with regular potting soil, and then place the seeds. Press the seeds about 1/4th to ½ inch deep into the soil. Please keep them in a warm environment and water them regularly.\nTransplant seedlings\nBefore transplanting the seedlings in your garden, bring them outside for one hour a day and gradually increase the time over a week. This will save the seedlings from the shock of the outside temperature. They will adapt quickly if you follow this process. You can bury the seedlings in biodegradable pots or cups in the garden soil.\nConsistent watering\nAs stated earlier, cauliflower plants require a constant water supply and nutrients for proper growth. The cauliflowers won't be tasty if these two conditions are not met. So, never miss out on watering the plant. These plants would require one to five inches of water every week. Make sure the water successfully reaches 6 inches into the soil. Also, remember not to overwater. The ground should remain moist, not soggy. If it frequently rains where you live, you might only need to water occasionally.\nMulching\nOnce the seedlings are established in your garden, add a thin layer of mulch to the soil to help conserve moisture and control temperature.\nCheck for pests\nYoung, delicate cauliflower seedlings are susceptible to several garden pests, such as cabbage worms, aphids, harlequin bugs, and others. Look out for them and use a plant-friendly pesticide to get rid of them and protect your crop.\nFertilize if required\nIf you see sluggish growth, test your soil and supply it with the missing nutrients, like nitrogen or potassium. Every two to three weeks, apply a fertilizer rich in the lacking nutrient(s).\nBlanch\nThe little head that develops at the center of the cauliflower leaves is called curd. Now, if this head remains exposed to light while growing, it will turn darker and not look pretty enough. Also, the texture will be harder. To keep the head white, a process is followed called blanching. For that, you have to bend the plant's leaves over the \"head\" when they are about the size of an egg to protect it from sunlight. If necessary, secure the leaves with rubber bands or twine. Also, don't be so firm that air cannot reach the head.\nHarvest\nAfter blanching, cauliflowers will take a few days to a few weeks to be ready for harvest. Look after the plant as usual, sometimes plucking the leaves around the plant's head to track its development and letting the water evaporate after watering. The cauliflowers will be ready for harvest when they are about 6 inches across, white, and sturdy.\nThis whole process from sowing to maturity takes between three and five months, but this time may vary depending on microclimatic conditions and the variety of cauliflower.\n \nHow to take care of cauliflower plants\nYou have to be quite cautious while taking care of cauliflower plants because they require all your attention. So, you cannot afford to miss anything written below: -\nSoil\nCauliflower requires an organically rich soil with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.0. Although cauliflower needs constant hydration, the soil should also drain effectively. Deep loamy soils would be ideal for the growth of cauliflowers.\nTemperature\nFor optimal growth of cauliflowers, the temperature should not exceed 26 degrees Celsius. The ideal temperature is 15 degrees Celsius.\nLocation\nChoose a location in your garden that is spacious and devoid of any big trees, tall grasses, or other structures that may shade the plants. Also, the place should be sunny.\nSunlight\nCauliflower likes bright, full sunlight for at least 8-9 hours. In case the heat is too scorching, provide some shade.\nFertilizer\nGenerally, if you have prepared your soil well, cauliflowers won’t require any fertilizer. But if you notice that the rate of growth is slow, you can perform a soil test and learn about the missing nutrients. Then add a fertilizer that is rich in those missing nutrients. You can also apply organic fertilizer once in a while, like compost or fish water.\nWater\nCauliflower requires a lot of constant moisture. The heads get bitter if there is not enough water. Make sure the water soaks 6 to 8 inches into the soil and gives plants at least 1 to 2 inches of water per week.\nMajor health benefits of cauliflower\nIt’s a treat when healthy vegetables are really tasty – isn’t it? Cauliflower is one such rare vegetable that is loaded with important nutrients. Take a look at the chart of nutritional value of one serving or 100gms of cauliflower: -\n\n\n\n\nCalorie\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n\n\n2 % of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrate\n\n\n5g\n\n\n\n\nFat\n\n\n0.3g\n\n\n\n\nIron\n\n\n2 % of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\nMagnesium\n\n\n3 % of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n\n\n299mg\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n1.9g\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n\n\n30mg\n\n\n\n\nVitamin B6\n\n\n10 % of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n\n\n100 % of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n\n \nBased on the nutrients present in cauliflowers, here is a list of probable health benefits: -\nImprove immunity\nSulfur-rich cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower may promote intestinal health and strengthen your resistance to infection. This is because sulfur helps to produce glutathione, which is essential for preserving the stability of the gut lining and promoting its regeneration. Glutathione acts as a powerful antioxidant throughout the body to protect cells from inflammatory damage. Also, remember that cauliflower has a good amount of Vitamin C, which helps boost immunity.\nProtects the heart\nRegular cauliflower eating promotes healthy blood flow throughout the body and maintains the blood vessels in optimum shape. It's because cauliflower contains glucoraphanin and vitamin K. As glucoraphanin transforms isothiocyanates, anti-inflammatory properties are triggered, and blood vessels are prevented from accumulating lipids. This encourages continuous blood flow through the blood vessels, thereby lowering the risk of conditions like atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, eating cauliflower helps to improve cardiovascular health.\nGood for bone health\nVitamin C, found in cauliflower, is essential for synthesizing collagen. The inflammatory damage to the bones and joints is stopped by collagen. In addition to vitamin C, cauliflower also contains vitamin K, which is responsible for good bone metabolism. Vitamin K helps heal wounds and injuries faster.\nMay prevent cancer\nCauliflower, like all other cruciferous vegetables, is anti-carcinogenic. The beneficial chemicals isothiocyanates, also known as indole-3 carbinol, sulforaphane, and glucosinolate, are present in cauliflower. According to numerous studies, the anti-estrogen and chemopreventive properties of the chemicals found in cauliflower serve to slow the growth of cancer cells.\nPromotes better digestion\nCauliflowers contain dietary fiber that helps improve digestive health by easily flushing out toxins from the body. The presence of sulphraphane, glucoraphanin, glucosinolate, and isothiocyanates helps in preventing stomach-related disorders and even stomach ulcers and colon cancer.\nAids in weight loss\nFor those looking for a weight-loss-friendly diet, cauliflower is a must. That’s because more than 90% of cauliflower is water. There is zero fat in cauliflower, and the presence of dietary fibers helps one remain full for longer.\nPromotes eye health\nYou will find antioxidants and vitamin C in cauliflower abundantly. Therefore, cauliflowers are excellent for lowering the risk of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, which leads to blindness among the elderly. Cauliflower also has sulforaphane, a substance that protects retinal tissues from oxidative stress-related damage. This vegetable may also help prevent vision impairment and cataracts.\n \nCauliflower is a beloved vegetable, and now it is becoming more popular as a gluten-free substitute for healthier living. Take care of a cauliflower plant today; tomorrow, it will take care of you. We hope this blog inspires you to bring cauliflower into your garden space.\nFAQs related to cauliflower\nIs cauliflower a winter vegetable?\nCauliflower is a vegetable that grows in the winter.

From omelettes to pancakes, as a dip for all kinds of fritters, momos, or flatbreads, and to jazz up any bland vegetable or lentil, the use of dhania patti is everywhere.\nCoriander, or dhania, proudly dominates Indian, Chinese, Thai, Mediterranean, Mexican, Caribbean, and many other cuisines across cultures.\nWhat’s more?\nDhania is a rich source of potassium, magnesium, calcium, and many other nutrients.\nWe will discuss the following things about coriander in this blog:\n\nInteresting facts to know about coriander leaves\nHow to grow dhaniya or coriander leaves at home\nHow to take care of coriander plants\nBenefits of coriander leaves in daily life\n\nLet’s dive into the world of coriander, then.\nInteresting facts to know about coriander leaves\n\nCoriander is a famous herb belonging to the Apiaceae family of carrots, asafetida, anise, etc.\nDo you know that all parts of this herb, from the fresh leaves to the seeds, are edible?\nIt is native to Southwest Asia, Northern Africa, and Southern America\nCoriander is a soft plant that grows to 50 cm (20 inches) in height.\nThe coriander plant also bears flowers. These flowers are white or pale pink in color.\nOne of the first spices that early settlers in North America produced was coriander, which was brought there around 1670\nThe word coriander was derived from the Greek word koríandron which referred to a bed bug due to its bedbug kind of smell\n\nHow to grow dhania or coriander leaves at home\nGrowing this flavorful herb is quite easy. Many people in India grow it at home because it is a staple in almost all dishes. Any tasteless or boring dish can be perked up with a dash of chopped coriander leaves. So, learn how to grow dhania or coriander leaves at home easily.\nTime to plant\nThe herb coriander dislikes extremely hot or cold temperatures. Therefore, if you live in a region with a temperate climate, late spring—between March and May—will be the optimum time to plant it. Coriander grows well in cooler months in tropical regions like India. This is why you'll find more coriander leaves in the market during the winter.\nMethod for planting coriander in garden\nPrepare soil\nIf you want to grow it in your backyard garden, you have to select a spot that gets full exposure to the sun. In the afternoon, provide some shade as well. This plant requires a light, well-drained soil with good airflow. The pH of the soil should range from 6.2 to 6.8.\nYou may cultivate the soil a bit before planting. With a shovel or spade, just dig up two to three inches of garden soil. For the soil's top layer, use organic mulch, like compost, dried leaves, or manure. If you use manure, be sure it has been matured for at least three months; otherwise, the young plants will be burned.\nPlant coriander seeds\n\nCoriander seeds are easily available in the spice market. Bring those seeds and plant them at a depth of around ¼th inch separated by at least 6 to 8 inches.\nYou should space your coriander seed rows one foot apart. At this point, water them well since they require a lot of moisture to germinate.\nOne inch of water per week is what coriander needs to grow, and you should expect to observe germination in around two to three weeks.\nGiven how quickly coriander develops, you should plant fresh seeds every two to three weeks to guarantee a steady supply of coriander throughout the growing season.\nAs you see the seedlings of coriander reach about 2 inches, you can use organic fertilizer or compost. The amount should not exceed 1-4th cup every week for 25 feet of total growing space.\nCarefully pull out the smaller plants and leave the stronger ones to grow. These smaller plants can be directly used for cooking after thorough washing.\n\nHarvest\nWhen the stems are 4-6 inches tall, harvest coriander by cutting off individual leaves and stems from the base of the plant. Remember not to chop off more than 1/3rd of the leaves, otherwise the plant will become weaker.\nMethod for planting coriander in pots\nChoose a pot\nFirst of all, choose a nice pot or container that is 18 inches wide and 8-10 inches deep. The width and depth of the pot are important because coriander doesn’t like to be moved, so you have to give it enough space from the beginning.\nPlant seeds\nFill up the pot with soil with good-drainage. Mix some fertilizer in it and moisten it until it's damp. Now, spread seeds lightly and evenly, and then cover them up with 1/4th inch of soil.\nChoose a favorable spot\nPlace the pot in a sunny area of your house for healthy growth. In a week or 10 days, seeds will start to germinate.\nWater further\nUse a spray bottle to sprinkle water on the plant. Don't use any normal-sized mug you use to water other plants because pouring with that intensity might displace the coriander seeds.\nHarvest\nThe coriander stems can be plucked as soon as they reach a height of 4 to 6 inches. Just cut up to 2/3rd of the leaves every week if you want to keep harvesting from the same pot for a longer time.\nHow to take care of coriander plants\nCoriander is one of the easiest plants to grow at home. It is an herb that is used frequently in food items on a daily basis. Therefore, it is a wise decision to plant coriander. Simply adhere to the care recommendations listed below to enjoy your delectable meals.\nWater\nAlthough coriander appreciates routine irrigation, the soil shouldn't be overly wet. You only need to dampen the soil to get started. Coriander can grow with just one inch of water every week.\nSunlight\nSunlight is good for coriander, but not for long periods of time. For its growth, an indirect source of bright sunlight is excellent.\nLocation\nSouth or east-facing windows or locations would be the best location for coriander plant pots.\nTemperature\nThe ideal temperature for coriander growth is between 17 and 27 degrees Celsius.\nFertilizer\nFor healthy coriander growth, use a liquid fertilizer or an organic fertilizer such as compost. It is sufficient to fertilize once a month.\nSoil\nCoriander requires soil with good drainage. The soil should be light and airy, and the pH should be between 6.2 and 6.8. So you can choose a soil that contains sand or perlite. Use a high-quality potting soil blend for your container gardening.\nPruning\nTo promote larger plants, pull back the young plants every so often by about one inch. Regularly cut soft stems from the coriander plant to extend the harvest.\nBenefits of coriander leaves in daily life\nAs per NIN or National Institute of Nutrition, 100gms of coriander leaves has the following nutrients: -\n\n\n\n\nEnergy\n\n\n31 kcal\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrates\n\n\n2gms\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n4gms\n\n\n\n\nFat\n\n\n0.7gms\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n\n\n146 mg\n\n\n\n\nIron\n\n\n5.3mg\n\n\n\n\nWater\n\n\n86.99gms\n\n\n\n\nFiber\n\n\n4.7gms\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n\n\n24mg\n\n\n\n\nVitamin A\n\n\n635mg\n\n\n\n\n \nThe probable health benefits of coriander leaves are mentioned below: -\nBoosts Immunity\nNumerous antioxidants included in coriander protect cells from the harm that free radicals can do.

        "articleBody": "Can trees be grown in pots?\nNo. That’s because trees refer to woody trunks with lateral branches that grow to considerable heights, which pots cannot hold.\nBut someone must have mulled over this idea of a world where perennial trees can be grown in pots or containers. This art form has existed since the 7th century and is known as bonsai.\nThe literal translation of bonsai is \"planted in a container.\" Bonsai is the art of growing decorative, artificially dwarfed trees in pots.\nSo, where did bonsai come from?\nThis art form was inspired by a traditional Chinese horticultural technique that was partially revived by Japanese Zen Buddhism.\nWhat is the purpose of growing Bonsai?\nThe goal is not the production of food or medicine, but rather the enjoyment of the audience and the grower's imagination.\nThere are numerous bonsai styles, and we will discuss the following in today's blog:\n\nFormal upright\nInformal upright\nSlanting\nSemi-cascade\nFull cascade\nRoot over rock\nBroom\nForest\nWeeping\nRaft\nDouble trunk\nExposed root\n\nSo, let’s get started then.\nBonsai styles that wins the heart &amp; spruce up home\nStyling is everything when it comes to a bonsai. They are mostly kept at home to draw attention from visitors and to uplift the décor. Among all non-living objects, they add a splash of life to a home. There are various styles of bonsai found worldwide. Here is a selection of 11 such cutting-edge styles that would jazz up your home and win the hearts of people.\nFormal upright – Chokkan\nThis is the most basic of all bonsai styles, and it's also the most visible.It reminds you of trees growing in your garden. The branches grow uniformly around the upright trunk, thinning somewhat as they ascend to the top.\nThe top of the tree is narrower than the base. The branches are spaced evenly to create a sense of depth that is pleasing to the eyes.\nInformal upright – Moyogi\nAn informal upright bonsai style is a formal straight style in the shape of an \"S.\" As is customary, the trunk is thicker than the top. The large trees you observe in your immediate surroundings are consistent with this design. The tree's \"S\" shape is likely the result of the trunk of the tree being broken by weather-related disasters such as rain, storms, snow, etc. Compared to the traditional upright bonsai style, it appears more realistic.\nSlanting – Shakan\nAs the name suggests, the trees in this style are bent drastically to one side. The tree appears to have been bent to one side by the power of wind or water. These trees have a stronger root system to balance the weight on the other side because of their slanting structure.\nFull cascade – Kengai\nA full cascade bonsai style is an art lover’s visual treat. You might want to award this style's innovator with a crown of honor. It looks like a tree is growing over a waterfall. The trunk of the tree remains downward, and the branches are pruned in such a way that they give you the visual impression of a waterfall. Because the nature of a tree is to grow upwards, it is often difficult for an artist to achieve this look. Therefore, a tall pot is necessary to maintain this style of bonsai.\nSemi-cascade – Han-Kengai\nThis one is quite similar to the full cascade style of bonsai, but with a less angular growth of the trunk. The low angle makes this style look more realistic. Therefore, the branches should be clipped to cascade downward, but not as severely as in the prior method. In this design, the tree extends past the pot's rim, and its trunk curves downward but not all the way to the ground.\nRoot over rock – Seki-Joju\nImagine a tree seed falling into a small crack in a rock and finding enough soil to survive; how would it grow? It may grow in two ways. Either it would find its way out or grow between the layers of soil and moss over the rock. Another possibility is that the roots gradually encircle and grow over the rock to the soil below, partially wrapping it. This style is achieved by bonsai growers by spreading the roots over a rock and letting them grow. It is heavenly to look at nature's beauty this way.\nBroom – Hokidachi\nThis design resembles a broom used for housecleaning, as the name would imply. Although the design is relatively similar to the formal upright style, it has a much bushier and more circular appearance overall. The appearance of a broom is created by carefully pruning the branches so that they curve upwards and outwards. This style is achieved mostly on deciduous trees, which have multiple branches originating from the same point.\nForest – Yose-Ue\nLike a small forest, here in this style, you will see a group of five or six trees. Trees of varying sizes are taken for this purpose. The smaller trees are positioned in front while the larger trees are kept behind. The branches of the smaller trees are pruned regularly so that they don’t block the view of the larger trees. To create a scalene triangle-shaped canopy, the trees are positioned at various distances from one another.\nWeeping – Shidarezakura\nThis bonsai design is pretty distinctive. The tree's name may have originated from the feeling that it is weeping. Weeping willows and cherries are the frontrunners for this style of landscaping. They are typically located close to lakes and streams. Each branch must be wired by the artists to bend upward and then downward, simulating weeping.\nRaft – Ikadabuki\nA clump of trees growing on top of a log is how the raft style is intended to appear. The branches of the trees are pruned in such a way that they cascade over the edges of the log, and the roots of the trees are visible on the log's surface. It is quite an interesting style, resembling a small grove.\nDouble trunk – Sokan\nYou get two trees in one tree—yes, that’s the specialty of this unique bonsai style. In this design, a single tree is produced by combining the growth of two distinct trees with various diameters. As a result, the base of the tree is sprouting two trunks, with no branches allowed to grow in between them. The smaller tree's branches have been pruned so that they do not impede the view of the larger tree.\nExposed root – Neagari\nTree roots are supposed to stay buried in the ground, right? In this distinctive bonsai design, the roots are visible from the outside. A tree may be uprooted by rain, storms, or any other type of extreme natural event, eventually exposing its roots. That idea may have served as inspiration for the bonsai artists who created this style. It exudes unmatched beauty.\nThere are many more styles of bonsai, and each one of them is exquisite.  Wherever you keep them, whether in the living room or the guest room, they will improve the overall appearance of your house. To bring more life to your home, decorate it with any of these unique styles of bonsai.\nFAQs related to Bonsai\nHow many types of bonsai styles are there?\nThere are five basic styles of bonsai, namely, formal upright, informal upright, slanting, full cascade, and semi-cascade. All other styles are modifications based on these five basic styles.\nIs bonsai a tree or a style?\nIn simple terms, bonsai refer to trees but in miniature versions that are grown in pots and kept indoors, unlike big trees outside. This is an old Japanese art form that stylizes the shape of a tree for visual pleasure.\nIs bonsai from Japan?\nBonsai is a Japanese art form of growing trees in containers or pots that has been developed from the traditional Chinese art form of penjing.\nIs bonsai lucky?\nAs per Feng Shui beliefs, bonsai is believed to bring good luck and harmony into your life. But the trick is that you have to get it as a gift from someone.\nAre bonsai difficult to care for?\nIf you follow the instructions provided by the grower, it is not so difficult to maintain bonsai. Watering, placement, fertilizing, and repotting must be done in time to care for bonsai.",

In India, Petha is typically grown in the summer months, from April to June. However, Petha can also be grown in other tropical and subtropical regions with long growing seasons.\nPetha can be grown at home in a number of ways. Here is the step-by-step process for easily growing Petha at home:\n\nChoose a sunny location to plant your Petha seeds. Petha plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil, so choose a sunny spot in your garden, balcony, or terrace to grow it. The ideal pH range for Petha plants is between 6.0 and 7.0. You can also test the pH of the soil using a testing kit for soil.\n\n\nPrepare the soil by loosening it and adding compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility. Adjust the pH of the soil if necessary by adding sulfur to lower the pH or lime to raise the pH.\n\n\nSow the Petha seeds directly in the soil, spacing them about 2-3 inches apart. Cover them lightly with soil and remember to water them well.\n\n\nKeep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Water the plants regularly, especially during dry periods.\n\n\nAs the plants grow, thin out any overcrowded seedlings to leave space for the remaining plants to grow.\n\n\nTo prevent Petha plants from falling over, it is important to provide them with support. This can be done through the use of trellises or stakes. Petha plants can grow quite large, so it is essential to ensure they have proper support to keep them upright.\n\n\nPetha fruits are ready to harvest when they are firm and have reached their full size. Use pruning shears or a sharp knife to cut the fruits from the plant, being careful not to damage the vines.\n\nWith proper care, you can easily grow Petha at home and enjoy this tasty and nutritious vegetable in your meals.\nHow to take good care of Petha plants?\nTaking good care of your Petha plants is essential for a healthy and bountiful harvest. You can take good care of your Petha plants by following the steps below:\nWater\nWater your Petha plants regularly, but be sure not to overdo it. Soil that is too wet can lead to root rot and other problems. Water your plants in the morning to give the foliage time to dry off before nightfall, which can help prevent diseases.\nSunlight \nPetha plants love the sun, so make sure to choose a sunny location for your plants. Full sun exposure is best for Petha plants. Ash gourd plants require at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day to grow and produce fruit.\nSoil \nPetha plants prefer well-draining soil and a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0. Test your soil's pH regularly to ensure it is within the ideal range for Petha plants.\nLocation \nIf you are planning to grow Petha vegetables in your home or garden, it is important to choose a location that gets plenty of sunlight, you can choose between your terrace, balcony, home garden or backyard! If you are growing ash gourds in containers on your terrace or balcony, it is important to choose containers that are large enough to allow for proper growth. Ash gourd plants can grow to be quite large, so make sure to use containers that are at least 18 inches in diameter and have drainage holes to allow excess water to drain out.\nTemperature \nPetha plants prefer warm temperatures, between 15-24°C (60-75°F). If you live in a cooler climate, be sure to protect your Petha plants from frost.\nFertilizer \nPetha plants benefit from regular fertilization. Apply a balanced fertilizer with equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) every 2-4 weeks. These nutrients are essential for plant growth and can be obtained through fertilizers or added to the soil through composting. It is always a good idea to follow the recommended guidelines on the fertilizer package and to test the soil to determine its nutrient levels before applying any fertilizers. \nPruning \nPetha plants do not typically require pruning. However, you may need to thin out overcrowded seedlings as the plants grow.\nPests and diseases\nPetha plants can be affected by pests and diseases, such as aphids and powdery mildew. Keep an eye out for any signs of infestation and take appropriate action, such as using organic pest control methods or removing infected plants.\nConclusion\nWe hope you found all the relevant information you were looking for here. Petha vegetables are an excellent choice for adding a new taste to your meals, or for cooking up a tasty, healthy snack for your family. \nThere are many uses for this versatile vegetable, and what's more, it can be eaten raw, pickled, or dried.

Its smell and petals have served as a source of inspiration for artists of all genres.\nFrom mending relationships to offering little moments of joy and relieving stressed minds – it has always come forward with a unique charm and elegance.\nThe subject in discussion is none other than the majestic rose, recognized as a universal emblem of love, peace, and romance.\nGardeners love it because it’s a woody perennial flowering plant that intensifies the glitz of a garden.\nWho wouldn't want a rose plant in their home?\nThis blog is ideal for you if you also want to grow it. This blog will go over the following: -\n\nAmazing facts about roses\nHow to grow the rose plants at home\nHow to take care of your rose plants\n\nSo, let’s explore the romantic and enchanting world of the roses.\nAmazing facts about roses\n\nFascinated by its beauty, perhaps, multiple countries have declared the rose their national flower. The list includes countries like the United States of America, England, Bulgaria, Iraq, and Romania.\nRoses belong to the family Rosaceae, which includes fruits like apples, pears, quinces, apricots, plums, cherries, peaches, raspberries, blackberries, etc.\nDo you know when a rose is most fragrant? Roses are most fragrant before sunrise, and that’s why the rose petals for rose oil production are collected at this time.\nRose is the national flower of Bulgaria, and did you know that this country has \"Rose Valley,\" which produces 85% of the world’s rose oil\nDavid Austin from England spent $5 million over a period of 15 years to produce a special rose. This rose is named \"Juliet Rose,\" and its color is apricot. It was sold for $15.8 million in 2006, making it the rarest and most expensive rose ever sold.\nDr. Sudhir Khetawat from India cultivates the \"Diamond Rose.\" It is the tiniest rose in the world, with just 1 cm of flower diameter.\nGiven their immense popularity, many people plant roses at home. Any idea how many rose plants are bought annually worldwide? It’s estimated to be a staggering 150 million.\n\nHow to grow the rose plants at home\nRoses are the most famous flowers in the world. From mass production in nurseries to the home garden, rose plants are found everywhere. Follow this blog if you're also mesmerized by the poetic beauty of roses and desire to bring a plant home. The following describes how to grow rose plants: -\nPick a type of rose\nThe types of roses that can grow in your garden or indoors will vary depending on your region's geography. There are plenty of rose types like Floribunda, miniature rose, hybrid tea, grandiflora, tree rose, shrub rose, landscape rose, etc. You can ask an experienced gardener or a local nursery which one to choose based on your region's climate.\nChoose between bare root and container rose\nYou have to know the difference between these two types of roses before you proceed.\nBare-root roses, as their name suggests, come with roots but no flowers. When you plant this one, the plant's energy is directed into growing its roots and branches and then generating blossoms, as opposed to maintaining the already-blooming flowers, as in the case of a container rose.\nContainer roses are those in which the flowers are already there. As a result, they start out looking pleasant and attractive when you plant them.\nFinding the best spot\n\nFind a location that receives at least 5 to 6 hours of direct sunlight daily in the morning for healthier rose plant growth.\nThe afternoon sunlight is harmful for the plants, and thus you have to either remove them or look for a place that enjoys morning sun and afternoon shade. If your location is windy, you have to create an obstruction like a fence or wall. The same applies for colder climate zones.\nThe soil at this location should be well-drained. Consider putting rose plants in raised beds if the soil is heavy since it will stay moist and damage the plant. Always check the pH of the soil, which should range from 6.5 to 6.8. For better growth at this stage, use organic fertilizers like compost or old cow manure.\n\nPlanting bare root roses\n\nThe best time to plant bare-root roses is before the arrival of the winter\nChoose a spot in your garden and dig a big hole—bigger than the roots—so that they have space to expand. If you are planting multiple roses, plant them at least 2-3 feet apart.\nMix some compost thoroughly with the soil until the entire mixture is molded into a mound at the bottom of the hole\nInsert the bare-root rose into the soil mound. In hot and humid regions, you should place it so that the bud union is just above the surface of the soil. If you live in a colder climate, the bud union should be one to two inches below ground level.\nTo keep any air pockets at bay, shovel the soil mixture around the bare roots. Then pat the soil firmly around the roots.\nNow, fill the hole with water. Once the water has been absorbed, refill the hole. Trim the canes so that they are just 8 inches long.\nMake a 6-inch soil mound over the plant to keep the canes from drying out\nIn two weeks, you will see the buds sprout, and this is when you can remove the mound\nThere is an old gardener’s trick that you can apply at this stage. You can stomp down on the mound a little bit, which will help the plant retain some moisture.\n\nPlanting container roses\n\nBring a container rose from a local nursery and plant it in the late spring or early summer\nIf you have kept the roses in the container for a while, that means they are moist, and you have to wait until this moisture evaporates.\nDig a deep hole. The depth should be as big as the plant container and twice as wide. This will allow the plant to spread out its roots.\nThe “container rose” may come in either a plastic or cardboard container. If the container is made of plastic, gently compress and release the plant by tipping the container on its side while holding the plant's main stems in your hands. If the container is made of cardboard, peel off the bottom and sides like you would an orange before inserting it into the hole.\nNow loosen the soil around the root ball to expose the roots and help them grow into the soil in the soil bed\nPlace the rose plant in the center of the hole and ask someone to hold it firmly while you fill the hole with a potting soil mix.\nPat the soil around the roots and around the hole. After that, water the plant. Wait a while for the water to drain off before starting over. The plant will start off strong with this.\nUse pine needles, wood chips, or bark to mulch the top layer of the soil, which will help the soil hold moisture\n\n \nHow to take care of your rose plants\nOnce you have planted rose plants in your outdoor, indoor, or terrace garden, all you have to do is follow some care instructions. To make your task easier, we have discussed that below: -\nSunlight\nA rose plant requires at least six hours of sunlight per day. Remember that this sunlight should be a morning one instead of an afternoon one, which is harsher. There are primarily two reasons why a rose plant prefers morning sunlight: one, the leaves like to stay dry, and second, afternoon sunlight is scorching and jarring and may hamper the plant. So, if you stay in a hot and humid region, provide some shade to your rose plants in the afternoon.\nLocation\nAs roses prefer 6–8 hours of sunlight in the morning, you can place the plants near any east-facing window. If you live in a hot and humid region, then place the rose plants in a location where they can get morning sun and afternoon shade. If you live in a colder climate, arrange a warm wall or fence to keep the rose plants away from the ruthless cold.\nSoil\nRoses grow best in well-drained loamy soil. The preferred soil pH is between 6.5 and 6.8. The drainage of the soil should be really good; otherwise, it will lead to the rotting of the roots. Also, check if the soil is too sandy or too thick. To improve your soil, add organic materials like dehydrated cow manure or compost.\nTemperature\nThe ideal temperature for a healthy growth of rose plants is between 15 and 28 degrees Celsius.\nWater\nIn the first year of planting, the rose plants require more water—around 10 liters of water spread over 3 days per week. Once the rose plants have established themselves, they grow best with thorough watering twice a week. Watering in the evening is not recommended because it promotes powdery mildew, a common disease of rose plants. Also, do not water the plant from above because that will dampen the leaves, and rose leaves prefer to stay dry. So, water only the soil. In colder months, water deeply once a week.\nFertilizer\nFeeding rose plants with 10-10-10 rose fertilizer once a month is a good general rule. The best time to feed rose plants with fertilizer is in the spring because they are actively growing then.\nPruning\nPruning in early spring is necessary for the overall health of the rose plant. You can prune roses in January if you live in a warm climate with little to no freezing over the winter. It may not be required to prune in warm-winter locations, but cleaning up is always a good option. Wait until April to prune if you live in a region that freezes during the winter, or until the leaf buds are full but not quite open.\n \n\nThe rose flowers are used to manufacture rose oil, rose water, and rose syrup, which are used profusely in food, cosmetics, and the medicinal industries. Rose tea is an important part of traditional Chinese medicine as well as Ayurveda. This tea is known to alleviate stomach problems, induce sleep, and reduce menstrual cramps. Rose water and rose petals have been used for centuries for glowing skin. In a variety of flower bouquets, roses are used to express deep love, admiration, and passion. Moreover, the beauty of roses is appreciated by everyone. So, to uplift your terrace, outdoor garden, or indoor garden, you can bring a rose plant and nurture it.\n \nFAQ’s related to roses\nWhat are the main uses of roses?\nRoses are primarily used to decorate the garden. The fascinating scent of roses is used in the perfume and cosmetic industries. In aromatherapy, too, roses are in high demand.\nWhich is the ideal month to plant roses?\nThe month just before the onset of winter is the ideal time to plant roses. Either plant roses in October–November or February–March.\nDoes a rose require full sun?\nA rose plant requires direct sunlight for 6–8 hours, but this should be morning sunlight. In the afternoon, kindly provide shade.\nWhere do roses grow best in India?\nThe major rose-growing states in India are West Bengal, Karnataka, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh.\nIs it hard to grow a rose from seed?\nIt can be difficult to grow roses from seed because the bulk of the seeds you collect frequently won't germinate despite your best efforts. The best ways to grow rose plants are \"bare root roses\" and \"container roses\".\nHow long does a rose plant take to bloom?\nA rose plant will take 28–70 days to bloom if it is planted at the appropriate time and given the necessary care. However, this period will differ for various rose varieties.",

        "articleBody": "You've enjoyed it in ice cream, in chicken recipes, as a morning drink, and every Christmas cake is incomplete without it...\nAny guesses what it might be?\nHint: It’s a famous citrus fruit.\nThe answer is orange. Sweet, tangy, and sour, oranges are adored worldwide for their nutritional values. Packed with vitamins and minerals, oranges are often known to be natural immunity boosters. They guard the body against cell deterioration.\nNot only that...\nDo you know that an orange has the highest vitamin C content of any citrus fruit, at 100% or more of the daily required amount?\nIn this blog, we will discover how to cultivate oranges at home. We will cover the following: -\n\nInteresting facts about oranges\nStep-by-step process of growing oranges at home\nCare guide for orange trees\n\nSo, let’s dive into the world of oranges.\nInteresting facts about oranges\n\nThe word \"orange\" is derived from Sanskrit nāraṅga and the color is named after the fruit\nBrazil is the largest producer of oranges in the world\nIn India, citrus fruits are the third-largest fruit industry, and oranges top the chart among citrus (after mangoes and bananas)\nIn India, Maharashtra produces the most oranges\nNot only the pulp inside, but also the orange peel, is beneficial. The orange peels can be used to remove grease and oil spots.\nOranges come in more than 600 different types\nYou would be startled to learn that oranges are almost 10,000 times more acidic than the pH of our blood. This is more than tomato juice but less than lemon juice.\n\nThe step-by-step process of growing oranges at home\nYou should be aware that an orange tree grown from a seed might not taste exactly like the fruit it was sown into before delving into great detail about how to grow an orange tree at home. The tree may need between four and fifteen years to begin bearing fruit. Additionally, keep in mind that this tree, which you grew from an orange seed, can be more prone to diseases. Most young trees you purchase from a nursery are crosses between two different species. This tree will begin to bear fruit in a year or two after the branches are cut from a healthy, mature tree.\nIn this segment, we will discuss how to plant an orange tree by seed and by the stem-cutting method.\nThe seed method\nSave the seeds\nOnce you have eaten the orange, save the seeds. Choose those seeds that don’t have any discoloration or dents. Remember that dry or withered seeds have a lower chance of growing.\nPrepare the seeds\n\nYou have to wash the seeds. Carefully hold them under running water and rub off any signs of pulp or other dirt.\nDon’t dry these seeds after washing them, as this will help them sprout.\nTake these damp seeds in a clean plastic bag and refrigerate them for 30 days before planting. Remember that a moist environment will help these seeds sprout faster.\nYou are advised not to use dried seeds, as they can take months to germinate or may not germinate at all\n\nPot and soil preparation\nTake a small pot and fill it with well-draining potting soil. Orange trees are not fussy about the potting mix. All you have to remember is that water should not collect around the tree; otherwise, the roots will rot.\nCompost\nBring some citrus potting compost and add it to the existing potting soil. It will enhance the soil’s ability to hold nutrients and make the soil more acidic—just the way oranges love it.\nWell-draining soil\nIf you find the soil to be poor at draining, mix some hardwood bark chips, which will allow the water to pass easily\nSow seeds\n\nPlace the seeds half an inch into the soil and water it\nYou can put a plate under the pot for the draining water\n\nKeep under sun\nOrange trees love full sunlight. Keep the soil in the sun and wait for germination.\nFertilizer\nAlthough it is optional, to hasten the process of growth, you may add a small amount of fertilizer every two weeks.\nSprouting\nSprouts should appear in six to eight weeks. The citrus family has the peculiar ability to create nucellar seedlings, which are precise clones of the mother plant. In general, the first and second sprouts grow the fastest, and the third sprout, which is smaller and grows more slowly, should be removed in order to produce oranges of higher quality.\nTransplant\nMove the seedlings to a larger pot as they grow. If you have space in your outdoor garden, plant the orange tree there. Just dig a hole deep enough to cover the roots and use the dug soil to cover them because potting soil holds too much water for orange trees, leading to rotting of the roots.\nPermanent location\nAllow your orange tree to enjoy full sun and a warm temperature. If the orange tree is exposed to high temperatures and scorching sun rays, hang a sun shade over the tree.\nWatering in time\nOrange trees require a lot of water, but they only need it once in a while. So, wait for the soil to fully dry up before you water again.\nApplication of fertilizers\nWhen it comes to fertilizers, you have to fertilize according to the age of the tree. For orange trees, you have to opt for citrus tree fertilizers or any other fertilizer that is high in nitrogen. If the tree is 2-3 years old, 2 teaspoons or 30 ml of nitrogen-rich fertilizer is recommended 3 to 4 times a year. This has to be done immediately after watering. If the tree is beyond 4 years old, then 0.45-0.68kg of nitrogen a year is required. February, July, and September would be the most favorable times to fertilize.\nRegular care\n\nRemove dust from your tender plants regularly because that hampers their photosynthesis process.\nKeep an eye out for diseases and take good care of your orange plant at this stage because you have to wait for at least 4 years or more to get fruits.\n\nThe stem-cutting method\nTime to plant\nThe ideal time to propagate orange trees from stem cuttings is late spring or early summer because this is the time when the growth of the current season has dried. Cuttings shouldn't be taken from branches that have a lot of active flowers or fruit.\nPot &amp; soil preparation\nUse a pot with a 6-inch depth and fill it with a 50/50 mixture of perlite and gritty quartz sand. Also take 6–10-inch cuttings from the tip of a healthy orange tree branch. Choose the one that is less than 1/4 inch in diameter and has a leafy tip. Cut 1/8 inch beneath a set of leaves using a clean knife.\nPreparing the stem\nRemove half the leaves from the tip and all the leaves from the bottom half of the stem, as well as any dry or new blooms. Then scrape off 1/8-inch-wide silvery bark at the base of the stem.\nRooting hormone\nNow coat the end of the cut stem with 0.1% IBA, or indolebutyric acid.

        "articleBody": "Imagine a family of achievers with a professor, a doctor, a lawyer, and an award-winning film-maker, and then they have a cousin who is a college dropout and works with an NGO.\nTurnip or shalgam, among celebrities such as cauliflower, cabbage, kale, arugula, or broccoli, feel like that cousin—underrated and underappreciated!\nThe nutritional value of shalgam may persuade people to adore it more.\nWhat’s so special about turnips?\nWell, turnips or shalgam are rich in vitamins and minerals like potassium, calcium, vitamin C, etc. Plus, they are easy to grow at home, which makes them a perfect plant even for beginners.\nIn this blog, we will go over Shalgam in depth and cover the following topics:\n\nHow to grow shalgam at home easily?\nCare instructions for shalgam cultivation at home\nBenefits of including shalgam in your diet\n\nSo, let’s dive into the cruciferous world of Shalgam.\nHow to grow shalgam at home easily?\nTurnip or shalgam are low-maintenance plants that require minimal care. So, even a beginner can think of planting it at home. The plant gets ready for harvest within five to ten weeks. The easy step-by-step process of growing shalgam at home is given below: -\nGrowing shalgam – outdoor home garden\nIdeal time\nThe ideal time to sow turnips would be in the spring or fall. Shalgam thrives in cooler temperatures, which is why you would see them regularly in the vegetable market during the winter season. Shalgam is harvested twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall. For spring turnips, you should sow the seeds 3 weeks before peak winter arrives, and for fall turnips, you should sow the seeds in mid-summer.\nLocation in your garden\nFind an area in your garden that gets at least 6 hours of sunlight daily for growing shalgam. Also, the selected spot in your garden should have naturally loose soil with good drainage. Turnips grow best in soil with a pH of 6.5, so you have to check your soil pH first.\nPrepare soil\nIn this stage, you have to check the quality of the soil and make it favorable for the growth of shalgam. Loosen the soil with a shovel to a depth of 12–15 inches. Now mix compost for the top 2-4 inches of the soil. You may also add mature manure to this compost, which will enhance the fertility of the soil.\nSow seeds\nBring shalgam seeds from a local store or order them online and evenly distribute them on your garden plot. After spreading the seeds, cover them with soil for 1/4th inch for spring season turnips and ½ inch for fall-season turnips. You can also spread the shalgam seeds in rows spaced 12 to 18 inches apart.\nGermination\nSeeds of shalgam will germinate in a week or two. Meanwhile, keep watering the plant. Just keep the top soil moist and stay away from overwatering.\nSaving the stronger plants\nAs the seedlings reach 4 inches in height, you have to pull out the weakest ones so that the stronger ones grow. If you have planted turnips for their greens, then you don’t have to pull out the thin ones.\nMulching\nWhen the plants reach 5 inches in height, add 2 inches of mulch around the greens. This mulching will get you better growth and a great flavor of turnips.\nHarvest\nAs soon as the shalgam greens are big enough to pick, you can harvest them. Typically, this occurs when the leaves are 4 to 6 inches tall (10 to 15 cm). When turnips reach maturity, pluck out the roots. After planting the seeds, this takes at least 5 to 10 weeks.\nBy gently brushing away soil from the top of one plant to reveal the root below, you can measure the root's size. The majority of the plants will probably be ready to harvest if that one plant appears to be.\nTurnips can be harvested at almost any size. The majority of people, however, prefer to pick turnips when the roots are between 1 and 3 inches (2.5 and 7.5 cm) in diameter since small turnips are soft and typically tend to be slightly sweeter than bigger ones.\nGrowing shalgam – indoor home garden\nPot for shalgam\n\nBecause shalgam is a root vegetable, choose a pot or container that is at least 12 inches wide. But in case you want to grow shalgam only for the green leaves, then a 6 inches width pot would also work just fine.\nAgain, remember that the size of the pot will depend on the type of turnip you want to grow. Those varieties of turnips that are bigger will require a bigger container for proper growth.\n\nCoffee filter\nNow that you have finalized the container, place a coffee filter at the bottom so that the soil doesn’t leach out of the drainage holes while you are watering.\nPotting soil\nFill in the pot with potting soil. Mix this soil with compost and perlite to provide nourishment to the plant and good drainage.\nSow seeds\nPlace the shalgam seeds 4–6 inches apart if you intend to use them as a root vegetable\nGrow under the sun\nPlace this container in a sunny location and check to see if it needs water on a daily basis. Turnip plants grown in containers require more water than those grown directly in garden soil. So, it is advised to water the plants until the water drips out of the drainage holes.\nThinning\nAs the plant reaches 4 inches in height, you have to thin it by removing the weaker ones\nHarvest\nWhen the plant becomes 6 inches tall, it is ready for harvest. Cut the leaves and leave the roots for further production. Harvest the shalgam when the roots have reached 2–3 inches in diameter.\n \nCare instructions for shalgam cultivation at home\nTaking care of shalgam plants is easy. Follow the instructions given below: -\nSunlight\nTurnips prefer full sunlight for at least 6 hours. But partial shades also work for them.\nLocation\nAny area in your home where shalgam can receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight will be great for placing the plant.\nSoil\nThe shalgam plants require a soil that is slightly acidic. The pH should be between 6.0 and 6.5. So, choose a well-drained, moderately deep loam—fertile soil—for growing shalgam.\nTemperature\nThe soil temperature should be 4 degrees for faster germination. Then a temperature between 10 and 21 degrees Celsius is ideal for the growth of the plant.\nWater\nJust an inch of water per week is sufficient for the growth of this root vegetable plant. But don’t let the topsoil dry, and water regularly for a nice and flavorful production.\nFertilizer\nTurnips don’t require fertilizer, but you can apply some organic fertilizer before planting the seeds, like compost or manure.\nDiseases\nThere can be an aphid or flea beetle infestation on shalgam greens. Use a hose to spray the beetles away in that situation. If turnip leaves have been overrun by aphids, pinch or eliminate that foliage to prevent the aphids from spreading. Turnips can be safeguarded against root maggots, despite the fact that they occasionally succumb to them, by spreading diatomaceous earth around the plants.\nBenefits of including shalgam in your diet\nThe green leaves of shalgam are loaded with health benefits. One cup of raw shalgam leaves has 6830 IU or International Units of Vitamin A and 33 mg of Vitamin C. The nutritional value of one cup of raw shalgam is given below: -\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n\n\n36.4\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n\n\n39mg\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrate\n\n\n8.36g\n\n\n\n\nFiber\n\n\n2.34g\n\n\n\n\nFat\n\n\n0.13g\n\n\n\n\nFolate\n\n\n19.5mcg\n\n\n\n\nIron\n\n\n0.39mg\n\n\n\n\nMagnesium\n\n\n14.3mg\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n1.17g\n\n\n\n\nPhosphorus\n\n\n35.1mg\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n\n\n87.1mg\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n\n\n27.3mg\n\n\n\n\nVitamin K\n\n\n0.13mg\n\n\n\n\nZinc\n\n\n0.35mg\n\n\n\n\n \nThis root vegetable can thus provide you with the following health benefits: -\nReduced risk of cancer\nAccording to medicalnewstoday.com, the risk of cancer is decreased with a high consumption of cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, and turnips. According to a 2015 study, sulforaphane, which is frequently found in cruciferous vegetables like shalgam, may impair the activity of the enzyme histone deacetylase, which is involved in the growth of cancer cells. You can find that study at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4432495/.\nLowering blood pressure\nA 2013 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology discovered that nitrate-rich foods like shalgam or turnips may improve blood vessel health. That includes lowering blood pressure and preventing the blood platelets from sticking to one another.\nAlso, don’t forget the potassium content in shalgam. This also aids in blood pressure reduction.How? That’s because potassium is a vasodilator, which eases the pressure on blood vessels and allows blood to flow more freely through arteries. This in turn helps to ward off different cardiovascular problems, including hypertension. Moreover, turnips are anti-inflammatory, and that’s how they can help curb any inflammation of the arteries.\nAids in digestion\nTurnip, or shalgam, is high in fiber and that’s why it is good for our digestive system. They help in increasing the formation of digestive juice and enzymes, which in turn help in the easy digestion of complex proteins and carbohydrates. Including turnips in your diet may help you with other digestive issues like indigestion, constipation, flatulence, a stomach infection, etc. But consult a doctor first if you have any digestive disorders.\nEffective for weight loss\nLow in calories &amp; high in fiber—that’s a perfect combination for weight-loss diets. Shalgam is thus the ideal food for those looking to shed a few pounds. Dietary fiber keeps one full for a longer time, reducing the tendency to overeat. Turnips have a low calorie count, and thus they can be eaten frequently without any worries, contributing to weight loss.\nGood for bones\nCalcium, phosphorus, and magnesium are important minerals that are required for healthy bones. Turnip is a rich source of all these minerals, so consuming this vegetable would increase bone density. Experts also say that if turnips are consumed on a regular basis, they can help prevent osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases. Moreover, shalgam is a rich source of vitamin C, which helps the body absorb more calcium, protecting bones from oxidative damage brought on by free radicals.\nGreat food for skin\nVitamin C enhances the radiance of the skin, and turnips are a great source of that. This vitamin C is a strong antioxidant that protects our skin from the risks of macular degeneration. Regular consumption of shalgam can aid in the prevention of aging, the removal of wrinkles, and the elimination of dark spots. \n\nTurnips are eaten raw in salads and cooked in a variety of ways. They are delicious in curries or soups and, as mentioned above, have many therapeutic effects. Any vegetable that you can grow in your yard is always a pleasure to have on your plate, isn’t it? That way, you can steer clear of chemical fertilizers often used in mass production.

If you have tulsi on your balcony or near the window, you will be taken care of. \nSoil – Tulsi requires a light, aerated, and nutrient-rich soil to thrive. A silty loam would be a great soil type for tulsi. You can use three parts peat moss, one part compost, and one part perlite for your indoor growth.\nLight – It grows best in plenty of sunlight. Tulsi appreciates a little bit of shade, but not too much.\nWater – Keep soil moist but not soggy for a healthy Tulsi plant at home.\nBenefits – Tulsi is known to cure colds, coughs, fevers, and asthma. It can also relieve your stress and regulate your blood sugar. Plus, the aromatic leaves reduce anxiety. The oxygen released by Tulsi at night helps you stay healthy.\nOrchid\nThe orchid plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family, a large and diversified genus of flowering plants with blooms that are frequently vibrant and fragrant. Do you know that orchids are the largest family of flowering plants? They have over 25,000 species, and perhaps there are more orchids on the planet than mammals and birds combined!\nSoil – Orchids like a light, well-draining soil to thrive. The common potting soil mix made for indoor plants may be too compact and dense for orchids. Therefore, add peat, bark, perlite, and sphagnum moss to the soil to provide orchids with the required nutrients.\nLight – For orchids to flourish, bright light is required. Bright, indirect sunlight coming from a south or east facing window would be ideal for its growth. However, direct sunlight may harm the orchid plant.\nWater – Water only when the soil appears to be dry. Water your plants once a week in the winter and twice a week in the summer.\nBenefits – Because it releases oxygen at night, this lovely flowering plant is a great option for the bedroom. Additionally, xylene, a contaminant found in paint, is absorbed by it. Your memory retention may increase by up to 20% when among orchid plants.\nLavender\nLavandula or lavender, belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, that is native to the mountainous areas of the countries bordering the western European part of the Mediterranean region. It is profusely used in pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries.\nSoil – Lavender grows well in well-drained soil. So, mix some coarse sand with regular potting soil for better drainage. Remember that an alkaline soil will boost the fragrance of lavender. So, choose a lean soil devoid of concentrated organic matter if you want better-smelling lavender flowers.\nLight – To get lots of buds and a bushy plant, place your lavender plant pot in direct sunlight. \nWater – Once it has established itself, lavender is a drought-tolerant plant. When it is young or during the first growth season, water it frequently. After that, water seldom to prevent fungus and root rot.\nBenefits – Keeping it in your bedroom will promote a sound sleep because this indoor plant releases oxygen even at night, plus it has a pleasant smell. Lavender, like other plants in the mint family, is effective at warding off insects like ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes.\nWeeping Fig\nThe weeping fig, also called Ficus benjamina, is primarily found in tropical and subtropical areas. The lush, evergreen foliage makes indoor places like houses and offices more attractive. This tree has a lifespan of 20 to 50 years. The weeping fig is a flowering plant in the Moraceae family that is native to Asia and Australia.\nSoil – The most important soil requirement for weeping figs is a well-draining soil. It is not dependent on nutrient-rich soil. So for better drainage, use potting soil that has been blended with sand, perlite, and vermiculite.\nLight – A bright room with abundant sunlight is the ideal setting for the proper growth of a weeping fig.\nWater – Keep the soil moist but not soggy. \nBenefits – Weeping fig can purify and clean your air of formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene.\n \nWe are more likely to invest in man-made machines to address any problems now that we are in an advanced telecommunications era, right? To maintain the cleanliness of our indoor areas, we frequently purchase air filters or humidifiers but overlook the more cost-effective alternatives. These green plants, a gift from nature, have a variety of skills. This collection of plants emits oxygen throughout the day and night, making it safer, simpler, and easier to maintain good health. Bring two or more indoor plants that give off oxygen 24 hours a day into your home and see the difference.\n \nFAQ’s regarding indoor plants that give oxygen 24 hours\nWhich indoor plant gives off the most oxygen?\nThe indoor plants that give off high levels of oxygen are the areca palm, aloe vera, gerbera daisy, snake plant, peace lily, jasmine, lavender, and tulsi.\nDo all plants give oxygen 24 hours?\nNo, not all plants can give off oxygen 24 hours a day.

        "articleBody": "Isn't a plate of peeled cucumbers familiar to almost all Indians, whether for lunch or dinner?\nThe elderly members of the family have always told us that cucumber is good for digestion, skin, and summer temperatures.\nThus, quite naturally, one word that comes to mind with the mention of cucumber is \"refreshing.\" The high water content of this fruit provides a cooling effect in sultry summer seasons.\nA sprinkle of black salt and black pepper tastes fantastic on this crunchy, slightly melon-like fruit. Mixed with onions, carrots, and some boiled peas, it becomes a proper, fulfilling, healthy snack item.\nIs that all about cucumbers?\nNo, cucumbers also help with weight loss, are nutrient-rich, antioxidant-rich, and boost the immune system.\nIn this blog, we will get to know cucumbers better and learn about the following:\n\nFew interesting facts about cucumber\n\nHow to grow cucumber (khira) from seeds\n\nHow to care for cucumber plants\nUnique health benefits of cucumber\n\nEager to learn more? So, let’s get started.\nFew interesting facts about cucumber\n\nIn the Cucurbitaceae family, cucumber is a widely grown creeping vine plant with cylinder-shaped fruits that is indigenous to South Asia.\nThe world's largest producer of cucumbers is China.\nAccording to legend, in 1494, Christopher Columbus transported cucumbers to Haiti.\nCucumber slices or puree might provide sunburn treatment right away.\nCucumber can also reduce the puffiness of the eyes and dark circles around the eyes\nAround the 2nd or 3rd millennium BC, India became the first country to domestically grow cucumbers.\nDo you know that there can be a 20-degree difference between the inside of a cucumber and the real temperature outside?\n\nHow to grow cucumber (khira) from seeds\nCucumber is an easy to growing high yielding plant. You can grow it easily at your backyard or opt for a bush gardening on your balcony or terrace. Just make sure, it receives plenty of sunlight and water. The following steps would help you to grow cucumber from seeds: -\nStep 1: Preparing the soil\n\nIn this step, you have to find a bright and sunny spot in your indoor, outdoor, or terrace garden area.\nRemove weeds from this area because they drain nutrients and water from the soil, starving your cucumbers.\nFor optimal results, yank up as much of the weed's root as you can by hand. There is a good chance that the same weed will reappear if the root is left behind.\nIt is suggested not to use herbicides as they make the soil unsuitable for overall growth.\nNow, check the soil pH and make sure your soil has a pH level of 7.0. If it is lacking, then you may add agricultural lime to increase the pH, and if you want to decrease the pH level, then add sulfur or aluminum sulfate.\n\nStep 2: Fertilize your soil\n\nThe slow-release granular fertilizer will best feed your cucumbers throughout their growth cycle if you're using inorganic fertilizer.\nUse aged manures or rich compost for natural fertilizer. They should first be blended into the soil to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm), and then cut and worked into the soil gradually until it is 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm).\n\nStage 3: Temperature check\nYou have to plant when the soil temperature is 21 degrees Celsius.\nStage 4: Water the soil\nDip your finger into the soil and see how moist it is before planting. If you feel the soil is dry, moisten the soil before spreading the seeds. Use a watering can so that the water is gentle on the ground.\nStage 5: Spread the cucumber seeds\nSimply scatter three to four seeds in a group every 18 to 36 inches on the ground or in a container. You can choose the strongest plant by planting many seeds together.\nStage 6: Seeds into soil\nSlightly press the seeds into the soil. The soil should not be sown with cucumber seeds deeper than 1 inch (2.5 cm). Alternatively, you might set them on top of the soil and then cover them with topsoil that is the same depth.\nStage 7: Spacing is important\nCucumber plants love space to grow. Cucumber vines grow up to a height of 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) and that will easily cover the ground in sizable gardens. So, you have to leave plenty of space to cucumber vines; otherwise, the produce would be bitter, and after a point, the plants will eventually cease producing.\nStage 8: Trellis for better growth\n\nCreating a trellis is suggested for better results. When cucumbers are grown vertically with the help of a trellis, they get better exposure to sunshine, and thus the produce multiplies.\nTo build a cage with a diameter of 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm), use welded wire fencing or hog wire that is 4 or 5 ft (1.2 or 1.5 m) tall. A cage of this size can hold two or three vines.\nYou can gently wrap the vine tendrils around the wire as your plant grows to encourage it to climb the trellis.\n\nHow to care for cucumber plants\nCucumbers are easy to grow plants but there are some basic minimal requirements that must be fulfilled. The basic requirements for a cucumber plant are explained below.\nSoil\nThe perfect soil for cucumbers is loose, light, and sandy because this type of soil gets warmer more quickly and retains that warmth more easily. If you have more clay in your soil, add organic material. Dense, heavy soil can be improved with peat, compost, or rotted manure. Also, remember that the soil pH must be around 7 for better cucumber growth.\nTemperature\nCucumber plants thrive in temperatures between 23 and 33 degrees Celsius. Therefore, if you live in an area where the temperature often increases beyond this threshold, you must shield your plants from the intense afternoon sun. Use tall plants nearby to offer some shade, or cover the plants with a cloth.\nFertilizer\nIf, as previously said, fertilizer was applied prior to seeding, then wait until runners start to grow on the vines and flowers start to bloom. Now apply either a organic feed, a light liquid fertilizer, compost, or aged manure every two weeks. Feed your plant a high-nitrogen fertilizer if you notice the leaves turning yellow, as this indicates that your plant needs more nitrogen.\nMulching\nWhen the seeds begin to sprout, add mulch. Mulch aids in preventing weed growth, which might deprive your cucumber plants of necessary nutrients. Additionally, it keeps the soil warm and wet. Use a darker mulch to offer more warmth.\nLocation\nThe bright and sunny spot in your garden, backyard, terrace, or balcony is the best location for the growth of cucumbers. You may also opt for the window that receives the most sunlight.\nSunshine\nCucumbers are a tropical vegetable, and that’s why they crave a lot of direct sunlight. So, choose a spot where they won't be too shaded from the afternoon sun. 6-8 hours of direct sunlight is thus a basic requirement.\nWater\nCucumber plants would require at least 1-2 inches of water every week for their hydration purposes. Also, moisten the soil surrounding the cucumber plants. When the plant blooms and begins to produce fruit, you must exercise extreme caution. A cucumber with a bitter flavor could come from underwatering at this time. Avoid overwatering because moist leaves might result in powdery mildew. You can opt for a drip irrigation system for a consistent flow of moisture.\nUnique health benefits of cucumber\nOne of the best things about cucumber is that it helps you stay hydrated and, due to its high fiber content, keeps you away from constipation. The following are just a few of the numerous additional health advantages of cucumbers: -\nRegulates blood pressure\nCucumber lowers blood pressure and lowers the risk of heart disease since it is a good source of magnesium, potassium, and dietary fiber. According to research, elderly people with hypertension and high blood pressure should regularly consume cucumbers.\nGood for weight loss\nCucumbers are minimal in calories and are 96% water. 100 g of cucumber contain only 15.5 calories. The amount of fat in one medium-sized cucumber is 0. They are excellent if you want to lose weight.\nAids good digestion:\nWe can keep our stomachs cool by eating cucumbers. Cucumbers' soluble fiber aids in slowing our digestive processes. Additionally, the high water content of cucumbers softens our stools, avoids constipation, and maintains regularity in our bowel movements.\nAlways keeps you hydrated\n96% of cucumber is water.

The crunchy, peppery, and juicy vegetable is eaten both in raw and cooked versions.\nRadish, often referred to as mooli, mula, or muli, is especially popular in the winter. People adore devouring radish-based pickles, paranthas (flatbreads), and daals (lentil dishes).\nThere are many varieties of radishes, and the pusa chatki radish is one of them. This variety of radish pusa chatki seeds has better adaptability and can tolerate high temperatures.\nWhat’s more about radishes?\nRadish is a heart-healthy food and an excellent source of vitamin C.\nYou can rely on this nutrient-dense vegetable to help you lose weight because it contains little calories.\nIn order to learn more about radish, the following topics will be covered in this blog:\n\nInteresting facts about Radish\nHow to care for Radish plants\nHow to Grow Radish at Home from Radish Pusa Chetki Seeds\nAmazing health benefits of Radish\n\nSo, are you ready to dig deeper? Let’s get started then.\nInteresting facts about Radish\n\nThe radish is an edible root vegetable belonging to the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Asia prior to Roman times\nRadishes are excellent companion plants, did you know that? It means you can plant them near other veggies like cucumbers, beans, or parsnips, and it will keep pests like flea beetles and aphids away.\nAITC is responsible for the strong, slightly pungent flavor you get when eating radishes. AITC is an organosulfur chemical known as allyl isothiocyanate. Do you realize that the strong flavor of mustard and wasabi comes from this colorless oil?\nRadishes are one of the most widely farmed vegetables, accounting for 2% of the world's total vegetable production\nTo obtain radish seed oil, radishes' seeds can be crushed. Even though the oil in wild radish seeds is too strong to be consumed by humans, it could be used to make biofuel.\nOn December 23, as part of Christmas festivities, Oaxacans observe the Night of the Radishes (Noche de los rábanos). A big kind of radish, up to 50 cm long and 3 kg in weight, is used in this folk art competition.\n\nHow to care for Radish plants\nRadish is one of the easiest plants to grow in your garden. You need minimal care for this plant.\nWater\nA wet but not soggy soil is what the radish wants. So, make sure the container has lots of drainage holes. If you plan to grow your plants directly in your garden soil, add compost to help retain moisture. You should water only when the top layer seems dry. Watering should only be done every two to three days during the winter. However, radishes respond well to drip watering.\nSoil\nRadishes do best in lighter, sandy, well-drained soils. This enables uniform root development and makes cleaning the harvested crop simple. Keep in mind that the pH of the soil must be 7.4.\nLocation\nRadish will grow best in any area of your garden that receives the most sunlight. Keep in mind that radishes need at least six hours of direct sunlight to produce nutritious and delicious vegetables.\nSunlight\nFor proper production of radish, the plant would require bright and direct sunlight for at least 6 hours daily. There can be some partial shade too, but that will decrease the vegetable size and increase the leaf size.\nFertilizer\nRadish requires almost no fertilizer at all. Fertilizers mostly help in the growth of the vegetation, or the leafy parts, but here we want the root tubers to grow. As a result, adding fertilizer will cause the radish leaves to grow larger. You may add 20% compost to the potting mix at the beginning of cultivation.\nMulching\nWeeds gather on radish plants, necessitating mulching. It would be beneficial to mulch the area with a thin layer of compost, untreated grass clippings, or weed-free straw.\nTemperature\nRadishes are cool-climate vegetables. Therefore, they grow best between 10 and 18 degrees Celsius. Radish seed germination requires an ideal soil temperature of between 7 and 29 degrees Celsius. Radish seeds won't grow if the temperature is above or below that, which will reduce yield.\nHow to grow Radish from Radish Pusa Chetki seeds at home\n\nTo produce radish, you must first select the proper location. Any location that gets both full light and some shade would be ideal. A sufficient amount of sunshine is necessary for growth; otherwise, they will simply increase in size with little root development.\nThe soil bed needs to be prepared now. For radish to grow, the soil must be loose and well-drained. Any big rock in the soil must be removed since it will divide the roots, disrupting their growth.\nVerify the soil's pH. It needs to be close to 7.4. This high of a pH will prevent club root, fungus, cracking, or rotting in the soil. If your soil has a lower pH, you can boost it by adding agricultural lime or dolomite lime in the fall.\nTo improve the health of the soil, add some organic fertilizer, such as manure, leaf mould, or compost.\nChoose the period of time when you want the radish to grow. Since they are often cold-weather crops, spring or fall are the ideal times to plant them. If you sow radish seeds in the spring, they will germinate in about 5 days and be ready for harvest in 3–4 weeks.\nAt this time, bring radish pusa chatki seeds and plant them. Keep the seeds spaced one inch apart and half an inch deep in the soil.\nWhen seedlings emerge after 4-5 days, thin the stronger seedlings to 2 inches apart to give them more room to thrive.\nPlanting distance for row cultivation should be one foot.\nIn order to ensure a constant supply of radishes in the late spring and early summer, it is also advised to sow additional rounds of seeds every 10 days or so while the temperature is still chilly.\nWatering radishes is essential as they grow. Remember to keep the radish beds moist but not soggy. Watering frequently will promote faster growth. Compost must be added since it will aid in the soil's ability to retain moisture. Radishes will crack if you don't give them the right amount of water.\nRadishes are typically ready to harvest when their roots are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Kindly check the seed packet for your variety's expected size at harvest and time to maturity. Lift the entire plant out of the ground with your hands to harvest.\nYou can remove some soil to check if a bulb has sprouted. That will indicate to you when they are prepared for harvesting.\nRadishes cannot be left in the ground like many other root vegetables since doing so will make them harsh and pithy.\nPull the radishes from the soil, wipe off the dirt with your hands, and store for up to two weeks in a cool, dry, and dark place. Wash them thoroughly before eating.\n\nAmazing health benefits of Radish\nRadish is a highly nutritious vegetable often suggested by doctors and elders of the family. A half cup of sliced radish contains the following nutrients: -\n\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n\n\n1-2 grams\n\n\n\n\nFat\n\n\n0 gram\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n\n\n0 milligrams\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n0.8 gram\n\n\n\n\nFiber\n\n\n1.9 gram\n\n\n\n\nSugar\n\n\n0 gram\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrates\n\n\n4 grams\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n\n\n23 milligrams\n\n\n\n\n\nGood source of vitamin C\nThe vitamin C in radish is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. So, it is good for collagen production to support the cartilage in our bodies. It can be of great help to arthritic patients.\nRegulate diabetes\nGlucosinolate and isothiocyanate, two chemical substances found in radishes, can help control blood sugar levels.

The interior of the bucket should next be properly greased with cooking oil to enable the release of the concrete. Pour the necessary quantity of concrete into the bucket now, and then mix the batter with water. It's important to keep in mind that this batter cannot be either too thick or too thin.

Marble plant stand\nThis DIY project requires a block of square or rectangle-shaped white marble, as well as an old or new sleek and tall side table. Place this marble on the side table.

        "articleBody": "Physical appearance is only a small part of what constitutes identity and value. This is one of the biggest truths in life.\nYou may frown upon the murky, unclean water, but it is where a lotus is born. And looking at a majestic lotus, you cannot have a clue about its birthplace, right?\nSimilarly, cow dung is avoided for its foul smell but is again used in various prayer rituals like havan.\nIn rural areas, people still use cow dung as a natural disinfectant to clean their homes.\nCow dung is considered auspicious and is put to various uses. From cleaning homes to providing nutrition to plants and vegetation, cow dung is of great value.\nCow dung cakes made from fresh cow dung are all you need for a flourishing garden. Cow dung cake is an organic fertilizer that carries essential nutrients for healthy plant growth of plants.\nIn this blog, we will learn about\n\nBenefits of using cow dung cakes\nHow to make cow dung cakes?\nHow to use cow dung on plants?\nOther uses of cow dung\n\nSo, are you ready to learn more about cow dung cakes? Let’s start.\nBenefits of using cow dung cakes\nCow dung contains three prime nutrients that plants require and that’s the biggest benefit of using it for plant growth. Read more about the benefits of using cow dung cakes for plants below: -\n\nCow dung has about 3% nitrogen content. Nitrogen is a prime component in chlorophyll, and without that, plants cannot make their food. It is also a crucial part of amino acids, which serve as the building blocks of proteins. Plants deteriorate and perish without proteins.\nOne of the key plant nutrients, phosphorus, is present in cow dung at a rate of 2%. It is a component of plant cells and necessary for cell division and the growth of the plant's growing tip.\n1% of the potassium in cow dung aids in controlling the stomata's opening and shutting, which controls the exchange of water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Produce suffers and plant growth is impeded when there is a potassium deficiency.\nIt is reasonable and cheaper to use cow dung cakes to reduce soil deterioration brought on by excessive chemical fertilizers, which can change the bacterial diversity and community structure of soils\nThe soil's ability to retain moisture is increased when cow dung cakes are mixed with soil\nYou don't need to water your plant as frequently because soils can hold more moisture after you feed it with cow dung cakes\nWith cow dung cakes, the aeration also improves, which helps break up compacted soils.\n\nHow to make cow dung cakes?\n\nFirst of all, you have to gather all of the excrement in one location. For improved processing, you must collect the feces for several days\nThe second step is mixing cow dung with water. Put on gloves and a mask for your hygiene. Avoid making it excessively thin or thick.\nThe third step is to make flat cakes. A thin and flat shape is much preferred because it will dry faster and would be better for carrying purposes later.\nThese cow dung cakes are dried on the walls of houses in rural India. To dry these cakes, use the side of your home that gets the most sunlight. Typically, it takes 3-5 days for everything to dry completely.\nNow put them away somewhere dry so you can use them later as fertilizer or as cooking fuel.\n\nHow to use cow dung cakes on plants?\nCommon method: -\n\n1 cake should be soaked in 2.5 litres of water for 2 to 3 days\nThe cake should be broken up and combined with water\nFeed the plant with 300 ml of the solution once every week\nUp to five litres of water can be used with a set of two cakes\nMake sure the soil has appropriate moisture before adding the solution to each pot\n\nFresh cow dung\nFresh cow dung should be avoided for direct application to plants because, first of all, it has a foul smell, and secondly, plants could be burned by the high concentration of salts and nitrogen present in the dung. It also includes harmful microorganisms like E. coli, that are toxic to both plants and people. Additionally, it includes weed seeds, which might result in an abundance of weeds or undesirable plants in your garden.\nAged cow dung\nThe more the cow dung ages, the better it gets. For that you can dig a hole in your garden and collect cow dung for several months. Cover it with your garden soil and let it age for at least 6 months. After that collect soil from here and use it as a fertilizer for your plants.\nDehydrated cow dung cakes\nThe one mentioned above in \"how to make cow dung cakes\" is dehydrated cow dung cake. Dehydration simply means a lack of water. After preparing the cake, you leave it to dry for 3–5 days, during which time the water content is absorbed and the cake is ready for use. Through this procedure, the amount of salt, ammonia, and dangerous bacteria is somewhat decreased.\nComposted cow dung\nThe greatest and safest organic fertilizer for your plants is produced when you add cow dung to the composting process. Composting cow dung has a number of advantages, like reducing dangerous ammonia levels, eradicating weed seeds already present in the soil, and enhancing soil drainage, aeration, and moisture retention. This kind of cow dung is the safest and best choice for plants and can be put once a month on the top soil after raking or tilling the soil, or it can be mixed with potting soil in a 20 to 30% proportion.\nOther uses of cow dung\nFuel and bio gas\nThe cow dung cakes are very good as fuel. People in rural areas manufacture their own cow dung cakes to use as fuel for cooking. Methane makes up 55% of the biogas, along with carbon dioxide (30%) and other gases including nitrogen and hydrogen. The entire collection of cow manure is used as feedstock to create biogas. It results from the anaerobic breakdown of cow dung. Cow manure may easily be converted into biogas. Certainly, using recycled cow dung expands the possibilities for creating a greener environment.\nHeating purposes\nIn colder regions, cow dung cakes can be used in fire places that will keep the room warm.\nMaking paper\nDo you know that the high fiber substance in cow dung cake helps produce high-quality papers? The fibers of cow dung are pressed into the paper. This is one of the lesser-known uses of cow dung cakes.\nDisinfectant\nIn rural India and in ancient times, people used to apply cow dung to their walls and floors to keep insects and mosquitoes away. Cow dung cakes are frequently burned in Indian houses in the evening since they are disinfectants.\nPurifies air\nYou must have seen cow dung cakes burned in almost all Indian festive rituals. The smoke coming from burning cow dung cakes is not only a disinfectant but also purifies the air. It is an anti-pollutant and possesses anti-radiation properties.\nFrequently Asked Questions related to Cow Dung Cakes\nCan we use cow dung directly for plants?\nNo, you cannot use fresh cow dung directly on plants, especially in a growing garden. The cause is because too many nutrients, including ammonia, are present in cow dung and could burn the plants. Before being utilized, this cow dung must first be composted.\nHow do you apply cow dung to plants?\nAfter combining cow dung in a 20 to 30 percent ratio with potting soil, it can be used. After raking or tilling the soil, it can also be applied once a month to the top soil.\nIs cow dung good for potted plants?\nYes, cow dung is good for the growth of potted plants. But keep in mind that before applying cow dung on potted plants, it must first be composted. Cow dung that has been composted has minerals, organic matter, and healthy organisms that are helpful for potted plants.\nWhat are the disadvantages of cow dung?\nThe biggest disadvantage of cow dung is collecting and processing. In addition, cow dung is a heavy material with little nutritional value. In order to see positive effects, at least 10 to 20 tonnes per hectare must be used. Cow manure also releases methane, a greenhouse gas..\nHow do you mix cow dung with soil?\nTo achieve the desired results, combine one part cow dung and three parts soil.\nWhy fresh cow dung should not be used for plants?\nFresh cow dung should not be used for plants because it contains high proportions of nutrients, including ammonia, that could burn the plants. As a result, it is advised to compost cow dung before using it on plants. \nIs cow dung poisonous?\nYes, cow dung is poisonous if consumed by humans.\nDoes cow dung make soil fertile?\nYes, cow dung makes soil fertile. It is an organic fertilizer that increases the nutrients in the soil.",

Let’s get started.\nTypes of watering can\nThere are numerous watering cans on the market, each with a unique appearance and feel, as well as being made of various materials. So, the experience would also be different. Here are some basic types of watering cans based on materials.\nPlastic watering cans: They are the most widely available type of watering can. Because of their light weight, anyone from a child to an elderly person can easily pick it up. Plastic watering cans can be easily loaded, unloaded, or carried. They are available in a large variety of shapes, colors, and sizes. Because there are no seams or joints, plastic cans are more resilient and less likely to leak. Additionally, plastic cans are less expensive, making them accessible to people of all financial levels.\nMetal watering cans: Compared to a plastic watering can, this type is a little bit heavier. However, metal or steel watering cans are incomparably more durable. You could drop it while carrying water, or it could fall from where you keep it, and the chances of it wearing out are negligible. Plus, the weight makes it difficult for your pets to knock it off. Another amazing fact about this watering can is that it is resistant to corrosion.\nCeramic watering cans: Ceramic watering cans are available for individuals who want to give their gardens a really opulent and refined touch. Ceramic watering cans would complement your home and garden's decor. These watering cans made of clay were painstakingly created for serious art lovers. The variety of designs that artisans create will astound you. You wouldn't want to jeopardise the lifespan of these gorgeous watering cans, would you? Therefore, only purchase it if you have an indoor garden. Ceramics are more likely than the other two to shatter right away if they are unintentionally knocked off.\nHow to choose the perfect watering can for indoor &amp; outdoor gardening? \nWhen choosing a watering can, you must keep certain aspects in mind, such as durability, design, etc. So, here is a proper guide on how to choose the ideal watering can for your indoor and outdoor gardening purposes.\nMaterial\nThere are metal, plastic, and ceramic watering cans available in the shops, and depending on your use, you can choose one of those. Plastic cans would be cheaper compared to metal or ceramic ones, but metal cans would be more durable. If you need to transport a large amount of water for your outdoor garden, you can use plastic cans because they are lightweight.\nWater holding capacity\nThe water container, or the main middle part of the can, is the body of the watering can. This is where the water is held until it is poured. Now, while picking a watering can, you must check if you can carry the weight of a filled watering can comfortably using one hand or not. If you have only an indoor garden, choose a lighter one. The water-holding capacity of most modern watering cans is around 2 liters. You will find smaller and bigger cans. Your choice of watering can would depend on the size of your garden and your or your gardener’s ability to pick it up.\nHandle\nFor the finest watering control, a watering can with one or two handles that allow carrying and tilting is excellent. For a more comfortable grip, choose circular-shaped hardwood handles. In comparison to a watering can with a thin handle, one with a flat, wide handle would be more pleasant. You can also opt for a watering can with a free-swinging, rotating grip rather than a fixed-grip one, as that will reduce pain while the can becomes heavier with water.\nSpout\nThe spout on a watering can is used to regulate the distance and flow of water from the can. It keeps water from being wasted. Depending on how you plan to use the watering can or how many plants you wish to water, you can choose a short, long, narrow, or deep spout.\nMouth\nYou will find two types of mouths for watering cans. One is a narrow one, and the other is a wider one. The wider mouth makes it simple to fill with water, and the narrow mouth prevents water spills. Decide what will work best for your circumstance.\nAdvantages of watering cans for indoor &amp; outdoor gardening\nA watering can may seem like a simple tool, but it actually makes the process much simpler, especially if you have a lot of indoor or outdoor plants that need attention.

You may also pick up all-purpose commercial potting soil, which has a similar ratio.\nGerminating seeds\nSoak the seeds in a bowl of water for a day. Scratch the tough outer layer off and immerse them in water. This will help the seeds germinate faster.\nPlanting\n\nPlace 2-3 seeds in each pot that is at least 7 cm in diameter. Each seed needs to be planted in the ground around 3 mm deep.\nGive the soil enough water. Keep it wet but not soggy. Inspect the soil as well to determine when to water it once more.\nPlace the pots in a well-lit area that receives plenty of sunlight. Keep the pots in some shade if you live somewhere hot and humid. For healthy growth, the pots should be exposed to sunshine for the majority of the day.\nThe seeds may germinate within a week in the best circumstances, with temperatures about 21 degrees Celsius. This could take two to four weeks in less ideal conditions or if you didn't soak the seeds the previous day.\nPut plastic wrap over the pot in case your room is too cool or dry.

Cut the weakest seedling if more than one sprouts in the same pot. The healthiest seedling's growth will be aided by this. Alternatively, you can move every seedling into a different container, but do so at your own risk. When your plant reaches maturity, move it to a bigger pot once the roots push against the container's sides or emerge through the drainage hole.\nLocation\nTry to keep the plant indoors, but also make sure it receives some sunlight throughout the day. So, an east-facing window is ideal.\nTemperature\nThe ideal temperature for the growth of the touch-me-not plant is between 15 and 30 degrees Celsius.\nSpace\nGive the plant enough room to grow.

        "articleBody": "If love can ever be described, the fragrance of chameli/Jasmine is enough to tell of.\nBut you cannot limit chameli or Jasmine to love, beauty, and sensuality only. There’s more to this mystical flower. Do you know chameli can release stress, induce sleep, and relieve muscle spasms?\nIn ancient times, and in some parts of our country even today, ladies use chameli to deck themselves up – as a hair accessory that works as a perfume too.\nChameli or Jasmine is a genus of shrubs and vines in the olive family. It is native to warm tropical regions of Africa, Eurasia, and Oceania. The gorgeous, white fragrant flower is often called “queen of the night” for the inebriating fragrance it releases at night.\nThat’s not all!\nFood &amp; beverage, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries use this flower to make various products that are widely popular.\nChameli is one of the easiest flowers to grow in your garden – indoors and outdoors. In this blog, we will cover various aspects of this immensely popular flowering plant.\n\nTypes of Chameli flowers\nHow to take care of the Chameli flower plant? \nHow to grow a Chameli flower plant at home? \n\nAre you ready to smell the chameli more? So, let’s get started\nTypes of chameli flowers\nLet's learn a little bit about the name and history of Chameli or Jasmine blossoms before we begin to describe the different varieties.\nThe English name of chameli is Jasmine, which comes from the Arabic word yasmin, meaning fragrant flower.\nAccording to some eminent botanists, Jasmine originated in Persia (currently Iran). From there it crossed the Red Sea before 1000 B.C.\nSome other botanists believe that Chameli originated in the Himalayas, specifically west China and Tibet.\nNow lets see how many types of chameli flowers are there to inspire us: -\n1.Common Jasmine\nJasminum Officinale, or common jasmine, is also known as Poet's Jasmine, True Jasmine, or Summer Jasmine. The white flowers have an intoxicating fragrance that has inspired artists for centuries. This is a fuss-free plant, which means it will grow and bloom even when you least care for it or keep it in the shade. It produces clusters of 3-5 flowers in late spring or early summer..\n 2. Dwarf Jasmine\nThis variety of jasmine is also known as Asiatic Jasmine. It grows barely 6-12 inches in height. The best thing about this chameli is that once well-established, it becomes drought-resistant. This type of Chameli is native to Japan and Korea.\n 3. White Jasmine\nWhite Jasmine is also known as Pink Jasmine. It is native to China and Myanmar. These star-shaped flowers are white inside and pink outside. It is a great outdoor plant but cannot survive a harsh winter. So, you have to take it inside your home during the winter season. Give good support to this climbing variety of Chameli and water every two weeks for a healthy plant.\n 4. Royal Jasmine\nAlso known as Regal Jasmine, Spanish Jasmine, or Catalan Jasmine, this type of Chameli flower is native to China, South Asia, and the Middle East. Royal Jasmine would require bright, sunny weather to prosper. Although it can grow in the shade, the flowers would be different from the ones in the sun. Keep the soil moist but not soggy. Also, add compost to the soil for better flowers.\n 5. Italian Jasmine\nThe buttery yellow blooms of the Italian Jasmine plant melt the heart. This pretty flowering plant attracts bees and hummingbirds most. It’s a treat to watch nature in action in the summer season when the whole shrub is ablaze with bright blooms and birds and bees dance around.\nRegular watering will make the shrub grow well and bloom more. Italian Jasmine can bear dryness and is resistant to pests.\n 6. Primrose Jasmine\nThe other name of Primrose Jasmine is Japanese Jasmine. It has soft yellow flowers and is indigenous to Southern China and Vietnam If supported, its long, slender, arching stems will ascend like vines. Remember to prune this plant frequently to keep the size under control because it grows quickly. Its lustrous, dark green leaves are covered with fragrant trumpet-shaped blooms. Early spring and occasionally summer see the appearance of flowers. Although less hardy, primrose jasmine is remarkably similar to winter jasmine.\n 7. Forest Jasmine\nThe Forest Chameli plant is indigenous to China and can reach heights of 6 to 10 feet. The opposing and trifoliate leaves of the forest jasmine are a robust to slender woody climber. At the tips of the twigs and in the axils of the leaves, flowers are produced.\n 8. Arabian Jasmine\nDo you know that Arabian Jasmine is the national flower of the Philippines and Indonesia? T This plant, which has a long history in the community, is thought to have originated in tropical Asia. The Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia are known to be the places where Arabian Jasmine originated. Ample amounts of water and ample sun rays are important for its growth.\n 9. Star Jasmine\nIn India, Star Jasmine is known as Kunda. This flower is associated with Lord Vishnu – one of the many deities in India. The Manipur state's wedding customs place a high value on Star Jasmine. Two Star Jasmine flowers are presented to the groom by the bride. The bride receives one of the flowers back from the husband after that.\nThis Jasmine species doesn't have a strong aroma in comparison to other Jasmine species. This shrub requires a lot of water, particularly when it is blooming. The soil must be kept wet but not drenched.\nThis variety of chameli is indigenous to China and Japan.\n 10. Lemon Scented Jasmine\nThis type of Chameli is native to Madeira Island, Portugal, and the prime requirement of this plant is warmth and sun.\nDespite the name, the fragrance of lemon-scented jasmine isn’t alluring. But if you smell it at sunset, you may get a strong scent as the fragrance emitted by this plant is highest during the sunset.\nRemember to prevent frost if you want to grow this plant. The soil should be well-drained and you must keep it slightly damp.\nHow to take care of Jasmine? \nWater\nWatering the Chameli plant is necessary during the growing season. Don’t allow the top soil to go dry. Remember that the soil must be moist, not soggy. In summer, water the plant every 2-3 days and check the dryness of the soil by inserting your fingers 2 inches into it. In the winter, water the chameli plant once a week.\nSunlight\nA sunny spot is perfect for this plant. If you have kept it away from the sun, make sure it somehow receives 4-6 hours of sunshine daily.\nPruning\nAvoid pruning before or during the blooming period, as this can have an adverse effect on blooming. But remove dead leaves, flowers and stems by either pinching them off or using hand pruners during the growing season.\nSoil\nA nutrient rich soil like loamy soil will be best for chameli flowers. The soil pH must be 6.5-7.5.\nFertilizer\nDuring the growing period, fertilize once a month for better and more flowers. Also, provide homemade compost regularly.\nSupport\nMany varieties of Jasmine or Chameli require firm support to grow up and you must provide that.\nDiseases\nUse a mix of water and neem oil to protect your Chameli flower plant from soft scales, mealybugs, aphids, or red spidermites.\nHow to grow Chameli flower plant at home? \nBefore discussing the step-by-step method of planting a chameli flower plant, you need to fulfil certain prerequisites mentioned below: -\nBest time\nThe best time to grow chameli is between June and November\nLocation\nA place that receives an ample amount of sunlight and is warm is ideal for the growth of Chameli plant.

        "articleBody": "You might have thought that the thin, fiber-like substance which holds the coir fiber in coconut husk was the most unimportant part of a coconut.\nBut in reality, it has the power to supercharge the growth of your home and lawn plants.\nThis substance, also referred to as cocopeat, is 100 percent organic and biodegradable.\nIn this blog, we will learn about\n\nWhat is cocopeat\nWhy use coco peat\nUses of cocopeat\nAdvantages of using cocopeat for home and lawn plants\nHow to use cocopeat to improve your home and lawn garden\n\nReady to dig deeper? So, let’s get started.\nWhat is Cocopeat\nCocopeat is also known as coco coir. It is the middle layer of a coconut drupe which is a thick fibre between outer and inner shell. This coir is used in upholstery, brushes, automobile seats, etc.\nWhy Use Coco peat\nThe typical potting soil you purchase at the store has its setbacks. It has drainage issues and the peat in it may cause environmental hazards.\nOn the other hand, cocopeat is eco-friendly, biodegradable and a smart way to use a waste product.\nUses of Cocopeat\nVastly speaking the uses of cocopeat can be divided into three broad categories mentioned below.\nHorticular uses\nAccording to  https://www.actahort.org/books/517/517_33.htm  “Cocopeat or coir dust is a by-product separated during processing of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) coir. As a by-product of coir manufacturing, cocopeat is often unutilized or burnt in the open. Of late, due to environmental concerns and also diminishing supplies of peat soils for horticultural substrates, cocopeat is being considered as a renewable peat substitute for use in horticulture.”\nThe uses of cocopeat in horticulture are mentioned below: -\n\nComposted cocopeat serves as good organic manure for plant and vegetation growth\nCocopeat is often used as an underlying layer in greenhouses\nIt has been brought to notice recently that peat moss contributes to global warming. So, cocopeat has been in great demand as it is eco-friendly and sustainable\nCocopeat is massively used in nurseries for germination of seeds. That’s because cocopeat retains moisture and provides a hospitable environment for seed germination\nFor the beginners in gardening as well as by veterans, cocopeat is used as a substrate in roof gardening. That’s because cocopeat is light-weight and retains moisture.\nCocopeat is a wonderful ingredient to enhance soil aeration, soil moisture, and soil texture.\nHorticulturists use cocopeat in potting soil to improve the water retention capacity of the soil\n\nAnimal bedding \n\nIt may surprise you that cocopeat alongside coco chips are used profusely as animal bedding for horse stables\nAs a mulch in landscaping coco chips are used\nCocopeat and coco chips are applied in animal bedding for pets like spiders, snakes, frogs, and lizards\n\nIndustrial applications\n\nCocopeat is used in the extraction of natural dyes\nCocopeat is light in weight and spongy in texture, making it an excellent oil absorbent in industries.\nIn manufacturing of particle boards, cocopeat is hugely used\nCocopeat is a great insulator for the production of fuse plugs and allied applications\n\nAdvantages of coco peat for growing home &amp; lawn gardens\nIncreases soil porosity\nSoil porosity is an extremely important factor in plant growth. It is the fraction of the total soil volume that is taken up by the pore space. Why is it important? Because without good soil porosity, air, water, and nutrients won’t reach the soil and improve plant growth.\nA good soil porosity is 50%, and Cocopeat has above 60% soil porosity. It means cocopeat will do wonders for your crops.\nEnhances water retention\nWith cocopeat application, the water retention capacity of soil increases by up to 800%. This means you can save a lot of water too, as the vegetative cover would require less water to thrive. When you have cocopeat in your soil, you can always be relaxed as your plants and crops won’t be affected by underwatering or overwatering.\nAlso remember that higher water holding capacity means the quantity of cocopeat required per plant would also be less.\nUsed for varied plants\nCocopeat is wonderful for all types of plants. Be it medicinal plants, flowering plants, leafy green vegetables, or succulents, every type of plant can grow well in cocopeat. It may surprise you that even tall crops like sugarcane can also be grown in this medium.\nIt is renewable\nOne of the best advantages of cocopeat is that it is renewable. So, there is no tension of this being finished from our environment. There will always be enough cocopeat for our future generations also because it can always be renewed.\nEasier to re-wet\nAs cocopeat is light-weight, it is easier to re-wet and that saves time and effort both.\nKeeps pests away\nCocopeat has antifungal and antibacterial properties which will keep the pests away. No pests means better soil porosity and better growth.\nPromotes root growth\nCocopeat promotes better root growth because it helps in better aeration of the soil. The more your soil is loose and airy, the better its root growth will be. And better root growth means better plant growth.\nEco-friendly\nCocopeat or coco coir is a natural waste product and when you are using it for plant growth, that means you are contributing towards a better environment. And this has a minimal impact on the environment. Peat moss—the thing that is greatly used by horticulturists or agriculturists, will take 100 years to restock, and that’s why cocopeat is being used more. Cocopeat is an eco-friendly option to enhance the vegetation, and that’s why it can be and should be used more.\nEasily available\nOnline or offline, you will get cocopeat easily through any medium of shopping. In the last few years, the use of cocopeat has considerably increased because of its bio-degradable, organic, and re-usable nature, which poses no danger to the environment. And that’s why it has become more available to people.\nAffordable\nIt is sustainable, eco-friendly, and also budget-friendly. Various companies will charge various prices—it’s true. But even then, cocopeat is much more affordable or cheaper than other growing mediums. The amount that you are paying now is nothing when compared to the overall impact it brings to your garden and stays forever.\nNeutral pH\nThe pH of cocopeat is neutral and this is an ideal condition for plant growth. It also means cocopeat doesn’t require any pre-treatment before sowing unlike other growth mediums.

Additionally, Coco peat is high in potassium and sodium. While this could be beneficial for some plants, it could prove harmful to others. Last but not least, coco peat can quickly become water-logged, particularly if there is heavy rainfall. \nHow long does coco peat last?\nCoco peat normally has a lifespan of up to 4 years. But it can be reused for several years, lasting as long as you want it to. \nWhich coco peat is best?\nFor providing ideal growing conditions, coco peat must have an even consistency, free of seeds, weeds, pests, and pathogens. \nIs it necessary to wash coco peat?\nYes, it is better to thoroughly wash the coco peat a few times in fresh water before use. \nCan I put Cocopeat on top of soil?\nCoco peat can be directly applied on top of soil.

Let’s get started.\n1. A Simple Ganpati Decoration with Flowers\nFlowers represent innocence and have been used since ancient times as an offering to God. Bring fresh flowers like roses, carnations, and lilies and use them creatively around the Ganpati temple. You can make garlands of marigold and jasmine and hang them around the idol. Use a drape of light shade and then hang bright colored flowers to make a gorgeous contrast. You can use white and red flowers as a frame for the idol. This Ganpati decoration idea is simple yet gorgeous.\n2. Cardboard Temple for Ganpati Bappa\nOnline shopping has increased over the years, and all our homes are loaded with cardboard boxes received from those deliveries. Take a small, medium, or large cardboard box and prepare first an outline for a temple. Cut it to size and then decorate with paint, coloured papers, and mirrors or other decorative elements. Place Lord Ganesha's idol inside this temple on a nicely polished wooden stool. Use decorative lights and flowers to highlight the temple more.\n3. A palm leaf background for Ganesh idol\nThe palm leaves have a unique structure that gives them an ornamental look. Use well-evolved deep green palm leaves to make an interesting background for the Ganesh idol. Decorate in a way that the palm leaves are facing upwards. For that, you can cut the leaves from the middle stem and glue them on your background, resembling sunrays. Complete this Ganpati decoration look with earthen lamps in a semi-circle in front of the idol.\n4. A simple Ganesh idol made from clay and paints\nClay used to be the prime material for making idols. But with time, various other toxic and environmentally hazardous things have been put to use to make the idols look more attractive. Remember that when visarjan/immersion happens, these idols with jewels and other decorations become a danger to the ocean. So, make your own Lord Ganesha idol or buy it from local artisans who use simple and eco-friendly materials. It is easy to make an idol at home. Use old newspapers and glue to make the base model first and then cover it up with ample clay. After it dries up, use paint to make it look attractive. You may watch a few YouTube videos to get a clearer picture. Place this idol on a wooden stool wrapped in a nice yellow cloth. Use colorful earthen diyas to border the stool with the idol.\n5. Make Ganesh Idols with Stones\nGather some round stones and pebbles for this unique Ganpati decoration idea. Wash them well and then color them in your favorite colors. Then use glue to make a Lord Ganesha idol. This would look amazing and everyone will gape at your creative powers! Use a cardboard or wooden block as a platform so you can use it every year.\n6. Floral decoration with Red and White Roses or Carnations for Mandap\nRed and white colors are often associated with Lord Ganesha. The red color represents activity in the world and also symbolizes energy, brilliance, and good luck. The white color represents the moon and symbolizes purity, devotion, and prosperity. So, a beautiful red and white floral decoration would be a great idea. Cover the table where Ganpati is kept with red and white flowers in alternate lines. Use a big thali and, in circles, glue the red and white flowers alternately. This will make a bright background for Lord Ganesha.\n7. A spicy Lord Ganesha\nOur Indian kitchens are filled with numerous spices, pulses, and condiments such as green cardamom, red chilies, turmeric, black peppercorns, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, nigella seeds, red lentils, kidney beans, etc. Glue these items on a strong cardboard or wood piece and border with oyster shells or paint.\n8. Mango Leaves and Banana Plants Décor for Ganesh Chaturthi\nMango leaves are used in almost all Hindu festivals. They symbolize the limbs of the god and are also known for waiving off negative energies. So, you can weave mango leaves along with bright marigolds to mark the entrance area of the Lord Ganesha mandap. Bring small banana plants that will be kept on two sides of the Ganesha idol. Isn’t this Ganpati decoration idea simple, easy, and fuss-free? \n9. Using Vertical Garden Frame as Backdrop for Lord Ganesh\nVertical gardens are climbing the popularity charts slowly. If you have a wooden frame vertical garden, you can use that as a background for keeping the Lord Ganesha idol and it will accentuate the overall look of the mandap 100 times.\n10. A Canopy of Colorful Flowers\nIsn't a canopy just so nice to look at? If it is constructed of vibrant flowers, you would not want to take it down at all. To have a canopy of red, white, and yellow flowers prepared, you may either make it yourself or work with a florist. Decorate this canopy by using fairy lights.\n11. A Feathery Backdrop\nIf possible, you can collect a variety of colorful feathers or you can stick to peacock flowers only. Cut out a rectangle or round shaped cardboard and simply glue these feathers on it. You'll have a stunning yet simple backdrop for Lord Ganesha. To draw attention to this aspect even more, use lights around the feathers.\n12. Indoor Plants To Place around Lord Ganesha\nPlants, when kept indoors, not only enhance the home décor but also purify the air, help assuage signs of stress, and keep diseases away. There are many small and beautiful indoor plants like peace lily, lucky bamboo, bonsai, jade plant, Syngonium plant, orchid plants, etc. Use these plants around Lord Ganesha to give a warm, relaxed, and eco-friendly look.\nWhy Celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi &amp; What’s the Significance of Ganpati Decoration?\nGanesh Chaturthi is one of the major festivals celebrated in India.

        "articleBody": "Capsicum (aka Bell Pepper) or shimla mirch in Hindi is one of the favourites in every Indian kitchen.\nThis uniquely shaped vegetable is enjoyed in many Indian dishes – the most notable being aloo-shimla mirch.\nCapsicum is one of those versatile vegetables that one can put in any dish (eg. fried rice, maggi, omelettes, etc) to enhance the taste, flavour or presentation.\nAnd shimla mirch doesn’t stop surprising you here!\nIt has lots of health benefits too.\nIt’s a rich source of vitamin C. Studies say that capsicum can prevent cancer, boost immunity, strengthen bones, and also reduce anxiety.\nIn this blog, we will get to know capsicum better and learn about growing tips at home. \n\nFacts about Capsicum plant\nHealth benefits of Capsicum\nHow to grow Capsicum at home easily\n\nGrowing capsicum using seeds\nGrowing capsicum using stem-cutting method\n\nGardening &amp; care tips for capsicum plant\n\n\nFacts about Capsicum Plant\nPer 100 gms of green capsicum is enriched with the following: -\n\n\n\n\nEnergy\n\n\n16 kcal\n\n\n\n\nCarbohydrates\n\n\n1.9 gms\n\n\n\n\nFat\n\n\n0.3 gm\n\n\n\n\nFiber\n\n\n2.1 gms\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n\n\n123 mg\n\n\n\n\nFolic Acid\n\n\n52 mcg\n\n\n\n\nBeta – Carotene\n\n\n328 mg\n\n\n\n\nVitamin A\n\n\n55 mcg\n\n\n\n\nHealth Benefits of Capsicum\nCapsicum further has the following health benefits: -\nRelieving stress and anxiety\nStress and anxiety are quite common among people these days. Small changes in diet can be beneficial. Capsicum has magnesium and vitamin B6, which maintain normalcy in the nervous system. It helps in relieving anxiety and preventing panic attacks. Not only that, but the muscle tension caused by anxiety is also reduced with regular consumption of capsicum.\nPreventing anaemia\nLow iron in the body causes anaemia, which in turn reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood. That’s why most people with anaemia feel tired all the time. Capsicum is high in iron and vitamin C, and when these two come together, it increases the oxygen flow in the blood.\nGood for heart health\nA study in 2017 suggested that those who consume capsicum daily have reduced chances of mortality compared to those who don’t. That’s because there are flavonoids in capsicum that prevent heart diseases.\nGood for diabetic patients\nCapsaicin, an ingredient in capsicum, is beneficial for diabetic patients. People with type 1 diabetes must consume this vegetable regularly, and within months a considerable reduction in sugar levels will be noticed. People with type 2 diabetes will also benefit from regular consumption of capsicums.\nImproves immunity\nA strong immune system is the biggest blessing one can ask for. With a proper diet, immunity can be enhanced. Capsicum is a rich source of Vitamin C, and foods that are rich in Vitamin C build a better immune system. Also, it protects against infection caused by the production of white blood cells.\nGood for eye health\nThe health of human eyes will benefit greatly from capsicum because Lutein and zeaxanthin – two carotenoids that protect the retina from oxidative damage, are profusely present in capsicums. Free radicals can grow in our eyes, which are immediately exposed to oxygen and light, and harm their cells. These two carotenoids will protect our eyes by neutralising those free radicals.\nPrevent cancer\nCapsicum is a rich source of antioxidants. Its anti-inflammatory properties are also notable. The presence of both of these qualities makes capsicum worthy of preventing cancer. carotenoid lycopene is present in capsicums, and that lowers the risk of bladder, prostate, cervix, or pancreatic cancer. Orange capsicums have been found to be most effective, as they can reduce prostate cancer growth by 75%.\nGood for arthritis pain\nThe anti-inflammatory properties of capsicum are related to conditions that are associated with pain. Patients with chronic arthritic pain benefit from it. The phytochemicals in capsicum engage with proximal nerve endings to mute them, eliminating the pain symptom in the process.\nHelps in menopause\nConsuming foods high in flavonoids, such as capsicum, can help women who are close to menopause.\nRich in vitamins and minerals\nNot only being high in fibre, capsicum is also a great source of micronutrients that are very helpful for bodily processes. Due to their high vitamin C content, capsicums are able to support a number of processes, including collagen production, wound healing, and immune system function. Along with vitamin C, capsicum also contains a lot of vitamin A, which is crucial for the immune system and reproduction.\nHow to Grow Capsicum at Home Easily? \nCapsicum is one of the easier homegrown vegetables. Clear out some area on your balcony or terrace and grow capsicum. It’s a beautiful feeling when you get to eat your homegrown vegetables. Nothing enhances the flavour of your dish like a freshly cut, organically cultivated capsicum – isn’t it?\nSo, follow the steps mentioned below and enjoy your home production of bell peppers or capsicum.\n\nStart the capsicum seeds indoors in early spring, and when they reach a height of about 4 inches, transplant them into the garden\nBefore you begin, you must first make the potting mix rich in nutrients. Peat moss and perlite should be used in equal amounts, along with some fertilizer.\nNow you have to sow the seeds on the prepared soil bed. Until germination takes place, lightly cover them and keep the soil moist. As germination occurs, take off the cover, and keep watering as required.\nAfter 2 weeks, you have to think about thinning out the plants as spacing is important for good growth. Keep in a sunny area and make sure there’s plenty of space all around.\n\nNow, look into two different methods of growing: -\nGrowing capsicum using seeds\n\nYou have to start preparing 8-10 weeks before planting outside if you are opting for this method. The seed preparation has to start indoors.\nCapsicum is almost a daily vegetable on the table, so you must be bringing it from the market often. Usually, you throw away the seeds, right? Don’t throw them away this time.\nUse those seeds to enjoy your own capsicum plant. Clean the seeds and dry them.\nTake a clean container and put in good soil enriched with peat moss and fertilizer. Sow the seeds and water the soil.\nCover the container well so that the seeds germinate. When you see shoots coming out, remove the cover and keep them in good sunlight.\nSo, choose a location that receives abundant sunlight. It will help the plants grow faster.\nThe temperature provided should not exceed 20–25 degrees Celsius during the day and 15 degrees Celsius at night.\nWatering is necessary; otherwise, the nutrients won’t reach the leaves. So, use a dropper bottle, spray bottle, etc. to water the seedlings daily. You have to make sure the soil is moist but not soggy.\nAs the plant is 3 months old, you will require a larger container.\nNow you have to expose the plant to cooler temperatures for a few days. As the weather cools down, place the capsicum plants outside in a shady area without direct sunlight. Continue this process so that the plant gets accustomed to the outside environment. As the temperature warms up, you can bring the plants inside.\nThis plant is then ready to be planted outside.\n\nGrowing capsicum using stem-cutting method\nStem-cutting is another innovative way to grow a capsicum plant. It saves much time compared to the seed method. So, start following the steps below and grow your capsicum plant.\n\nFirst of all, you need to collect some healthy stems of the capsicum plant and trim the leaves or flowers.\nTake a nice, big container or plant pot and fill it with compost, followed by nutrient-rich, well-drained soil.\nNow moisten the soil, and then take the stems and carefully put them in this soil\nFind a warm and sunny spot in your home to place this pot\nThe moment you find new leaves, pinch them back to encourage new growth\nSome say that using a propagator is the ideal way to grow capsicum plants at home. It's nothing more than a plastic container with a lid to cover it. You need to fill this container with potting soil, put in the stem, and cover the lid. This is the same as mentioned in the seed process.\nYou can do the same thing with a normal pot and cover it with a plastic bag\nKeep the pot under good sunlight for at least 2 weeks before transplanting\n\nGardening &amp; care tips for capsicum plant\nLocation\nAny location in your home, garden, or terrace that receives an ample amount of sunlight is ideal for the growth of a capsicum plant.\nWater\nBell peppers or capsicum require deep watering. If you live in a place with high temperatures, then water this plant twice a day. Dry conditions don’t produce good quality capsicum. And again, over-watering will kill the roots. So, monitor your watering times closely. A well-drained yet moist soil is what capsicums need.\nSoil\nA well-drained soil that has received manure, compost, and organic fertilisers is ideal for growing capsicum plants. You can increase the calcium level of the soil by adding dolomite or lime, but be sure to monitor the pH to make sure the soil stays acidic.\nCompanion plants\nThe thing is, capsicums grow well around other plants like cucumbers, corn, and carrots. But refrain from putting it near fennel or cabbage plants.\nFertiliser\nTo encourage the growth of your bell peppers without reducing the frequency of fruit production, fertilise with a substance low in nitrogen.\nSunlight\nCapsicum plants need full, bright sunlight to flourish. So, choose a sunny spot in your indoor or outdoor garden and grow your own capsicums. In case your place is already hot and humid, you can provide partial sunlight to your plant by placing capsicum plants under big, shady trees.\nTemperature\nA capsicum plant will need 25-30 degrees Celsius at day time and 18 degrees Celsius at night.\nBottomline\nApart from bringing that extra zing to your dishes, capsicums are also a blessing for good health. As mentioned in the blog, the antioxidants present in bell peppers help boost immunity, enabling us to fend off numerous infections and disorders. It is also simple to cultivate at home. What are you still holding out for? Get your tools and start growing bell peppers at home.\n \nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Capsicum Plant\n1.How long does capsicum take to grow?\nCapsicum usually begins to fruit 12-15 weeks after planting or sowing. However, temperature, soil variety, and sunlight play a role in determining how long it will take to grow.\n2.Is capsicum easy to grow?\nYes, capsicums are fairly easy to grow at home yourself, provided you follow the right technique and instructions!\n3.Does capsicum need full sun?\nCapsicum plants love the sun and warmth. But since they thrive in moderate temperatures, it is best to pick a spot that is partially shaded.\n4.How often should I water capsicum?\nThe frequency of watering your capsicum plant depends on the weather. The plant can be watered twice a day if the weather is excessively hot, and only once every 2-3 days if the weather is cooler.\n5.How long do capsicum plants last?\nUnder the right conditions – including stable, warm weather – and care, capsicum plants can go on to live for several years. A lot also depends on the variety of the capsicum itself.\n6.How many capsicums do you get off one plant?\nOne capsicum plant, on an average, will produce 6-10 capsicums during the growing season. But then again, the weather, amount of care, and variety of plant will also help determine the number of capsicums you get.\n7.How can I make capsicum grow faster?\nCertain tips could make your capsicum plant grow faster. These include transplanting at the right time, using a fertilizer, pruning regularly, and watering prudently. You should also try and make sure your plant receives the right combination of sun and shade.\n \n \n\n\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Apart from the population, what’s that one thing that we keep making more and more of every day? It’s waste!\nOrganic, re-usable, recyclable, plastic, or ceramic – waste in every form is thrown away or discarded every minute of the day in every corner worldwide.\nThe world would definitely look healthier, greener, and prettier without these waste materials. Maintaining standard protocols like using dustbins isn’t enough. And again, not everyone is Nek Chand (the one who made Rock Garden, Chandigarh), but if some of us start making the best out of waste materials, our ecosystem will improve a lot.\nPlenty of waste materials that keep piling up at our home can be used to intensify our indoor or outdoor garden spaces. How? By making plant pots from waste materials, there can be a considerable deduction of waste from at least one home.\nTo prepare your new \"best from waste\" model of garden, you need only a few simple materials that are readily available at home.\nReady to give your creative cells some work? So, let’s get started and make some beautiful plant pots from waste materials: -\n 1. Plastic Bottle Planter\nThis is perhaps the most widely used or most promoted \"best out of waste\" craft idea. Plastic has crept into our lives almost like oxygen – every second item in our households is made of plastic – isn’t it? Among all the plastic items, the use of plastic bottles is the most common.\nBottles of cold drinks or drinking water bottles made of plastic can be beautifully used to make planters. You need to cut them in the middle horizontally (with cap intact) and poke some small holes at the opposite end for better drainage. Now put in some potting soil and grow coriander, fennel, green chilies, petunias, or whatever plant you like.\nYou can make multiple plastic bottle planters at home, use ropes on both ends to tie them properly, and then hang them on your wall. It will look like a nice vertical garden against your wall. Plus, the aesthetic value would increase.\n 2.Old Bird Cages Planter\nHave you ever had birds? If yes, then you must have a bird cage. Your mom must be complaining about the space this bird cage eats up in the storeroom, right? She will be happy when you put this useless, wasteful object into something worthwhile.\nBring out the cage, clean it, and check if it has rust. Use a rust remover, paint it, but before that, check which portions of the cage you need to cut for ease of maintenance (putting soil, plant, applying water, etc.).\nAs a base for this cage, use coir liner, burlap, or chicken wire and moss. If it is large enough, you can simply put small containers of plants inside the cage. Now use potting soil or good quality garden soil.\nPut succulents, air purifying plants, annual or perennial flowering plants, or decorative plants in this cage planter.\n 3. Dustbin Planter\nHow long have you been using the dustbin of yours? If it looks old and you are planning to buy a new one, then use this old one as a planter.\nYou can grow your favorite veggies, flowers, or ornamental plants in it.\nIf you have that large or extra-large size of dust bin, simply use good quality garden soil and grow your own tomatoes, potatoes, or carrots. You can keep this planter on your balcony and grow perennial or annual flowers in it.\nThe metal or plastic dust bins can be given a makeover before using them as planters. Clean it up, paint it with two contrasting colors like black &amp; orange, black &amp; gold, red &amp; white, blue &amp; white, etc. Grow colorful flowers in them and when they bloom, keep them beside your main door to welcome guests.\n 4. Jute Rope, Paint, &amp; Plastic Container\nAll you need is a plastic container, jute rope, and acrylic or fabric paint for this unique and colorful planter. The plastic container can be medium-sized (250 gms).\nGlue the jute rope all around it and then make a hole at the bottom for drainage. Now use paint to make this planter look brighter.\nPut some potting soil in and grow your green friends. Water it regularly and give it some sunshine too.\nIsn’t this best out of waste idea too easy to make at home?\n 5. Egg Cartons Planter\n99% of us throw away the egg cartons after the eggs are consumed. Do you know that egg cartons are an example of recycling and reuse? They are made up of various materials, such as recycled paper, cardboard, molded pulp, and different polymers.\nEgg cartons, made from recycled materials, can be further used as planters. They have clearly marked compartments, and that’s why it is easier to grow various flowers or veggies in them easily.\nUse potting soil, put in seeds of various plants you want to grow, and then moisten the soil. Keep the carton in a warm space so that germination occurs soon. You can put the carton in a plastic vegetable bag for this purpose.\nAs you see them sprout, remove the plastic, then set your container in a sunny, warm spot until they are ready to be planted outside.\n 6. Coconut Shells Planter\nAs Dussehra arrives, the use of coconuts in our kitchen increases. Various sweets are produced using coconuts, and then you are left with way too many coconut shells—isn’t it?\nUse these coconut shells to grow some herbs, succulents, or microgreens. If growing herbs, you can use the kitchen window space to keep these coconut planters.\nYou may opt for perennial herbs like oregano, chives, rosemary, mint, etc. to spruce up your kitchen all year long.\nMake a small hole at the bottom of the shell for drainage and fill it with good quality herb soil or potting soil. Plant seeds of the herbs you want to grow, water thoroughly, allow some sunshine, and enjoy your dishes.\nYou may use some paint to color up the shells and write the name of the herb you are growing on them.\n 7. Alcohol Bottle Planter\nSome alcohol bottles are just too creative to throw away – isn’t it? But keeping them stacked in a box is only going to eat up your space.\nBring them out, clean them, and use them as planters. If you want you can paint them too, make designs with acrylic pens, etc.\nFill a few alcohol bottles with water and place a money plant by snipping a few stems from a tree. Keep it beside a window, so that the plant can crawl up the rods and add much beauty to your place.\n 8. Ceramic Mug Planter\nCeramic mugs look ravishing. Some have cute quotes, while some have funny emoji and some have personalized images. How many big ceramic mugs do you have at home? Most of them are kept as show pieces only as we are too scared to put them to daily use.\nThen there can also be some ceramic mugs that you don’t use anymore after many years of usage.\nSo, convert these colorful, medium-sized or big-sized ceramic mugs to planters.\nMake a hole at the bottom of your selected ceramic mug and fill half the mug with cactus soil. Place the succulent that you brought.And now fill up the rest of the mug with some more soil.\nAdd water and your \"best out of waste\" planter pot is ready for display. Use these ceramic mug succulent planters as bookends or as your coffee table accessories.\n 9. Wine Cork Planter\nGather some wine or champagne bottle corks for this best out of waste planter pot idea. This innovative planter will impress anyone coming to your home.\nTake a sharp knife and make a hole of approximately 0.8 cm in diameter and 2 cm in depth. After that, glue a small magnet to this cork. Allow a few hours for the magnet to dry and then put in some good potting soil.\nNow cut a small stem of a succulent and place it carefully in this soil. Pour a few drops of water.\nYour creative cork planter is ready to be hung from your refrigerator door or your wall. It would be nice if you made 3–4 of these wine cork planters, as the tiny planters would look better together in a cluster.\n 10. Mason Jar Planter\nBring out the used mason jar and clean it up. Dry it and then put 1 inch of stone at the bottom. This layer of stones will work as an internal drainage as mason jars don’t have holes. After this stone layer, put ½ inch layer of charcoal. This layer of charcoal will balance the soil pH, preventing bacteria and assisting in drainage.\nNow add potting soil and place the desired plant in it. Keep it wherever you want, but make sure it receives good sunlight and water.\nYou may decorate this jar more by using spray paint or glitter.\n 11. Tin Can Planter\nUsed tin cans of clarified butter, oil, etc. can now be used as an attractive planter. Wash the tin cans well and dry them up. Use a hammer and nail to make three or four holes at the bottom for drainage.\nUse spray paint to spruce up the tin can and an acrylic pen to write a nice quote. Put in potting soil and place a cactus, succulent, or ornamental plant, or any annual flowering plant of your choice.\nWater the soil and make sure it receives some sunshine too.\n \nRef links:\nhttps://housing.com/news/diy-plastic-bottle-planters-for-modern-homes/\nhttps://empressofdirt.net/make-birdcage-planter/ https://theprojectspot.blogspot.com/2012/05/garbage-can-planter.html https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/propagation/seeds/egg-carton-seed-tray.htm\nhttps://rainforestbowls.com/blogs/product-spotlight/plants-to-grow-in-coconut-planters\nhttps://jewelpie.com/craft-money-plant-in-glass-bottle/ https://craftychica.com/2014/06/coffee-mug-planters/ https://arts.onehowto.com/article/how-to-make-wine-cork-planters-6348.html\nhttps://homesteadbrooklyn.com/all/2017/1/12/how-to-build-a-mason-jar-garden\nhttps://www.homedit.com/easy-diy-tin-can-planters",

        "articleBody": "Mogra is one of the most beautiful and fragrant flowering plants in India. Popular for its pearl-like white hue, Mogra is known as moonshine in the garden.\nIn historical context, women have used the Mogra flowers as a hair accessory since time immemorial. The powerful aroma of Mogra flowers has worked as a natural perfume.\nIn religious context, Mogra is considered to be the offspring of the Goddess Lakshmi according to the Puranas. The God of Love, Kamadeva has 5 flowers in his arrows and one of them is Mogra.\nIn the scientific community, Mogra is known as “jasminum sambac” - an indigenous flowering plant of tropical Asia that grows prolifically in India &amp; Pakistan. It is also the national flower of the Philippines.\nThe story of the Mogra plant isn’t over yet.\nMogra (Arabian jasmine flowers) have proved successful in treating several skin conditions, respiratory ailments, intestinal worms as well as mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. Hence, Mogra has applications in both pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries.\nThe best part?\nGrowing Mogra in your garden or balcony is super easy.\nIn this article, we’ll learn\n\nHow do you grow Mogra at home?\nHow can you make Mogra bloom more?\nPro-level gardening and care tips for Mogra plants\nThe best fertilizer to use for Mogra plants\nWhere to place Mogra plants at home for best Vastu?\n\nAre you ready to dive in? Let’s get started.\nHow to grow a Mogra plant at home easily?\nThis easy-to-care, low-maintenance Mogra flowering plant can be grown inside or outside the home with the help of three major methods – seedlings, pot method, and stem-cutting method.\nWe will discuss all these methods here so that you can enjoy the beauty of Mogra flowers.\nSteps to mogra with seeds\n\nAbsorb the seeds for a whole day before planting.\nFill a six-pack cell with potting soil and soak it in water.\nSet aside some time to drain off the water before planting one seed in each cell.\nAfter this, use plastic to cover the cells so that the moisture is retained.\nNow put them in direct sunlight.\nWhen you see two pairs of leaves arising from the seeds, re-pot them.\n\nGrowing mogra with stem-cutting method\nVarious research studies have shown that by the stem-cutting method, the Mogra plant grows at a faster rate as compared to other methods.\nSo, if you want to grow in bulk or want a faster result, then stick to this method. Steps for growing mogra using stem-cutting method are as follows:\n\nTake a stem-cut by visiting a nursery nearby or by ordering online or asking a neighbor whose Mogra plant is healthy.\nRemember to use a sterilized knife for cutting the Mogra stem.\nNow, slit a 6-8 inches long clip from a healthy Mogra plant that is located just below the leaf node.\nClear the stem off any leaves, blossoms, or buds.\nTake some rooting hormone in a glass or small container and dip the end of the stem in it.\nThen fill a planter with some moist sand and put the stem in it.\nPlace the planter in a plastic bag for moisture retention.\nMake sure to keep the planter at a 75-degree angle.\nAlso, make sure that no direct sun rays can reach it.\nWithin a month, roots will be prominent and now, you can transfer this into a pot using nutritious potting soil before placing it in your garden.\n\nThings to remember\nWhile decorating your space with a new Mogra flowering plant by stem-cutting method, just remember a few things:\n\nThe most favorable time to root stem cuttings is from spring to summer.\nThe most favorable temperature is around 22 degree Celsius.\nWhile propagating the Mogra plant, stick to either early morning or evening.\n\nGrowing Mogra using the pot method\nGrowing Mogra in pots is safe and secure. Because when the climate is adverse, you can carry a pot easily inside your home from your outdoor garden space.\nTo propagate the Mogra plant in a pot, you need to follow these steps:\n\nBuy a nice 12 inches or bigger round earthen pot for growing Mogra plants. Earthen pots are the traditional ones and allow plants to breathe, unlike plastic ones. Plus, earthen pots are eco-friendly.\nUse well-drained organically rich soil.A combo of loamy soil and well-decomposed cow dung manure (in a ratio of 2:1) would work best for faster growth of Mogra plants.\nBoth direct sunshine and shade are required for the growth of Mogra plants. For bigger Mogra flowers, direct sunlight is the best food for the plant. So, choose a place in your garden under a bigger tree or plant where Mogra can get direct sun rays for some time and then enjoy the shade.\nA window will be ideal for Mogra plants in terms of their sunshine requirements.\nDaily watering is essential but also remember not to over-flood the plant.\n\nFlowering season of Mogra plants\nSome types of Mogra flowers bloom throughout the year but most Mogra flowers bloom during summer and rainy seasons. Therefore, spring to early summer will be the correct time for you to plant them.\nHow to take care of Mogra flowering plants?\nMogra is not at all a fussy plant. If the simple requirements are met, it will give you wonderful results. Read below and know how to take care of Mogra flowering plants easily:\nWater\nSummer months would require more watering because that’s the peak time for Mogra flowers. Generally, the Mogra plant requires a lot of water so when you find the top layer dry, water the plant. But remember not to over-flood with water as that will lead to rotting of the roots.\nSoil\nMogra plants grow exceedingly well in fertile but slightly acidic soil. The soil has to be well-drained too. So, two parts of loamy soil mixed with one part of well-decomposed cow dung would be a perfect soil condition for adequate growth of Mogra plants.\nSunlight\nA bright sunny day is required for bigger blooms of Mogra but again continuous exposure to sun rays may kill the plant. So, choose a location where the plant receives sunlight for half the day.\nDefoliation\nWhen you have stopped watering the plant, it will start to shed leaves. In case that doesn’t happen, all the leaves should be removed manually.\nLocation\nAs Mogra plants require partial to full sunlight, you can choose the ideal location – either indoor or outdoor depending on the design of your home.\nIf you have a lovely window where sunlight falls for half of the day followed by nice shade, you can keep the Mogra indoors. If you have such favorable conditions outside in your garden then Mogra can be located outdoors.\nFertilizer\nFertilizing 3-4 times a year is considered ok for the fast growth of Mogra plants. For more blooms and better quality flowers, a light dosage of phosphorus-rich fertilizer would be required.\nTemperature\nMogra grows abundantly in Asia and that’s why it is a typical tropical plant that dwells well in warm weather conditions. Exactly 22 degree Celsius is regarded as ideal by many but it may vary anywhere between 5 – 26 degree Celsius depending on other physical conditions.\nHumidity\nOne of the striking features of a tropical plant is that it would require a good humid atmosphere. The ideal humidity can range between 50-80%. So, make sure your Mogra plant is never devoid of water.\nPruning\nOnce the flowering season is over, you should prune otherwise it will give rise to a vine. Chop off the unhealthy stems, remove the yellow leaves, and make cuts above the buds and nodes. All these would accentuate the growth of the plant more.\nDiseases\nGenerally, Mogra plants are disposed to whiteflies, aphids, black-scale insects, etc. When your Mogra plant is affected by such pests, remove them immediately or cut the affected part. Then spray a fungicide like neem oil to bring the plant back to good health.\nIs Mogra good for Vastu in your home?\nMogra is a strong-smelling flower and as per Vastu studies; any flower with such a strong fragrance will bring growth and prosperity to a home.\nSo yes, Mogra would be a good flowering plant for your home and the Vastu experts recommend it highly. But the story doesn’t end here!\nMogra or jasmine symbolizes love, positivity, appreciation, and good luck. Consequently, your home would become happier and healthier.\nThe sweet smell of Mogra flowers would calm the mind and agitated nerves, help to relax, and reduce anxiety.\nWhat are the different uses of Mogra plants?\nMogra isn’t only about the pearl-white highly fragrant flowers. It is much more important than just being a symbol of beauty.\nRead below about the various uses of Mogra:\n\nWe all love the Mogra flowers and in return, Mogra flowers are equally important in retaining our beauty. Do you know that Mogra water is naturally therapeutic? Mogra water enhances the radiance of the skin and retains moisture, helping the skin from drying out.\nMogra can help build a better and stronger internal system by boosting the efficacy of digestive enzymes.\nMogra leaves are used to treat breast tumors.\nJaundice and other venereal infections can be treated by Mogra.\nThere is the presence of antibacterial qualities in Mogra that works as a disinfectant.

        "articleBody": "Home is the only place that protects us from every harmful ailment like sunlight, bad colds, strong winds, pollutions, etc. We love our home as we feel that it is the safest place to live. But the fact is, indoor air also contains certain concentrations of toxins sometimes even more than outdoor air when there is no proper ventilation. Yes, it’s true. Here is the detailed information of some of the air purifying plants along with the sources, chemicals involved, and protective measures of indoor air pollution.\n           We all know that some indoor plants help in eliminating harmful toxins and improving household air conditions. But these plants only help in reducing the concentrations of these chemicals but not in eradicating their emissions into the air. So, knowing the sources from where these chemicals are getting emitted into our indoor air is also important to find any solution for it. By this we can reduce the use of those entities (sources) and of course can grow plants accordingly (according to chemicals present). So let’s have a glance at those sources and the chemicals which they emit.\n \nSources of indoor air pollution:\n1. Burning of traditional fuels:\nAccording to WHO(World Health Organization), annually around 4.3 million people are dying due to household air pollution. Can you believe it? And the main source of this pollution is the burning of traditional fuels like firewood, charcoal, cow dung (emits dioxins) for cooking purposes.\nChemicals/pollutants they emit:  Particulate matter, CO, NO2, SO2, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\n        \n\nimage source\nUsing these fuels (mainly in villages) is may be our tradition, but they result in emissions of many harmful pollutants (mentioned above) when we see it scientifically. Women and children (in villages) are mostly affected by these chemicals as they spend most of their time indoors. This is why they are more prone to lung cancers, strokes, heart problems, and also to some pulmonary diseases.\n \n2. Burning of organic materials:\nBurning of organic materials like wood, coal, and petroleum products (like kerosene) also results in the emission of chemicals into our household air. Even in urban areas these organic materials are used to heat water and for other purposes\nChemicals they emit: Benzene, xylene, toluene.\n3. Tobacco smoke:\nIt is a known fact that tobacco is injurious to our health. It not only ruins our health but also ruins the environment. Tobacco smoke contains more than 7000 chemicals, that are detrimental to both humans and the environment. Out of these 7000, 70 chemicals are known to cause cancers in humans. We call these cancer causing chemicals carcinogens.\n     \n\nimage source\nChemicals they emit: Benzene, toluene, and formaldehyde.\n \n4. Dry cleaned clothes:\nDry cleaning may improve the longevity of your clothes but many chemical-based solvents are used in this process of cleaning. Those chemical residues present in the clothes escapes into the air and pollute it.\nChemicals they emit: Trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene.\n \n\n5. Paints, resins, glues, lacquers, building products, paper products:\nAll these products contain formaldehyde in their composition which is a serious air pollutant. Due to its toxicity, it is banned in the USA and some other countries. It is even classified as a human carcinogen by WHO. We all are exposed to small amounts of formaldehyde that is emitted by these products around us. \nChemicals they emit: Formaldehyde along with some other traces of elements.\nFormaldehyde can cause problems like eye, skin, and throat irritations. At higher exposure, it can cause cancers too.\n \n\n6. Household products: \n\nProducts like dishwashing liquids, detergents, pesticides, carpets, insect repellents, air fresheners, deodorants, electric appliances, wooden furniture are composed of many chemicals, and some of these chemicals get emitted into the air and pollute it. \n\nimage source\n\n\nChemicals they emit: Volatile organic compounds(VOC).\n          As these chemicals escape into the air in the form of vapor, they are known as volatile organic compounds. Most of the above mentioned chemicals like benzene, toluene, formaldehyde comes under this group of chemicals. At higher concentrations, these chemicals can result in eye irritations, respiratory problems, and headaches. \n \n7. Other sources:\nMany products like cement pipes, gaskets, clothing, cement flat sheets, vinyl floor tiles, roofing coatings etc that are present in our home are made of using asbestos as an ingredient in their compositions. \nChemicals they emit: VOC, asbestos.\nAsbestos is banned in 55 countries as it is a carcinogen and known to cause lung cancers, asbestosis, mesothelioma, and many other health problems in humans when inhaled.\n So these are some of the sources of air pollution and this is how our indoor air gets polluted. There is a need to protect ourselves from these harmful chemicals in our home. Using chemical formulated sprays or products to reduce their concentrations is not a permanent solution as they can’t be used all the time and may lead to some or other problems. The simplest solution to this problem is growing air-purifying indoor plants. \nLike how trees purify the outdoor air, some indoor plants can purify the indoor air. These plants help in removing harmful particles (chemicals, pollutants) that are present in the air. In order to improve the air quality in a sealed spacecraft, NASA has conducted a study on plants in 1980 and they concluded that the roots and soil of house plants reduced airborne VOC. So they have recommended a few plants that performed well in purifying air. You can place these plants in different places in your home to keep your indoor air healthy.  \n \nAreca palm, Aloe vera, Spider plant, Rubber plant, Broad lady palm, Chrysanthemum, Gerbera daisy, Weeping fig, Money plant, Dracaena, Aglaonema are some of the air-purifying plants that are recommended by NASA. Besides these plants Peace lily, ZZ plant, Boston fern, Fiddle leaf fig, English ivy are also known to improve the air quality around us. Let’s take a sneak peek into the toxins they remove.\n \nAir purifying plants and the pollutants they clear/remove:\n\n\n\n\nSl.no\n\n\nAir purifying plant\n\n\nToxins/pollutants it removes\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nAreca palm\n\n\n Xylene, toluene, formaldehyde\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nSpider plant\n\n\n Carbon monoxide (CO), xylene\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nSnake plant\n\n\n Benzene, xylene, toluene, formaldehyde,   trichloroethylene\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nChinese evergreen (aglaonema)\n\n\n Benzene, formaldehyde\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nRubber plant\n\n\n Carbon dioxide (CO2)\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nMoney plant\n\n\n Benzene, xylene, toluene, formaldehyde\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nAloe vera\n\n\n Benzene, formaldehyde\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nBroad lady palm\n\n\n Ammonia (in cleaning products)\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nDracaena/dracaena\n\n\n Xylene, trichloroethylene\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nWeeping fig\n\n\n Xylene, toluene, formaldehyde\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nGerbera daisy\n\n\n Benzene, trichloroethylene\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nPeace lily\n\n\n Benzene, xylene, toluene, formaldehyde,   trichloroethylene\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nBoston fern\n\n\n Xylene, formaldehyde\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nEnglish ivy\n\n\n Benzene, formaldehyde.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nZZ plant\n\n\n Xylene, toluene, benzene.\n\n\n\n\n16 \n\n\nChrysanthemum\n\n\n Benzene, xylene, formaldehyde, and   ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n \n1. Areca palm:\nAreca palm is the most popular indoor plant and is available in different sizes in nurseries. It is tolerant to partial shade to full sun. They can be grown even outdoors but are mostly maintained indoors to have bright interiors. It is a very good air purifier.\n\nimage source \n\n\n\nToxins or chemicals it removes: Xylene, toluene, formaldehyde.\n\n\n\nCommon problems:\n\n\nOverwatering and keeping the soil wet all the time leads to problems like the browning of tips and yellowing of leaves and stems. So let the soil dry between every watering\nSometimes yellowing may also occur due to inadequate sunlight. In that case, place the plant in areas where it receives bright filtered sunlight.\n\nCare tips:\n\nUse well-drained soil or potting mix \n\nProtect the plant from strong afternoon rays in hot summers when maintained outdoors\nPlace the plant near any window if maintained indoors\nWater only when the top inch of the soil becomes dry as the areca palm is sensitive to waterlogged conditions.\n\n2. Snake plant:\nSnake plant is a wonderful indoor plant with many unique features. It stays unique in both shape and patterns of leaves. Besides purifying air, it also releases oxygen during nights. You can also place this plant in your bedrooms to improve the air conditions. It can tolerate a wide range of sunlight that is low light to full sun conditions. One can maintain it both indoors and outdoors.\n\nimage source\n\n  Toxins or chemicals it removes: Benzene, xylene, toluene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene.\nCommon problems:Yellowing of leaves: Like any other plant, yellowing, and dropping of older leaves are common. If there is yellowing in other leaves then it may be due to placing the plant in the complete shade (even without fluorescent light) or overwatering or nutrient deficiency.If the yellowing is not due to shade/overwatering, fertilize the snake plant once a month in the growing season to improve the condition. \nCaring tips: \n\nAs snake plant is a succulent, water requirement will be low. It performs well even if you watered thoroughly once a week\nBright indirect light is ideal for its growth and development\nDo not overwater the plant as it may lead to soft and soggy leaves\nAlways use well-drained soil for succulents. It cannot stand wet/waterlogged conditions as it may lead to the rotting of roots\nDo not fertilize the plant in winter as it will be dormant.\n\n \n3. Aglaonema/Chinese evergreen plant:\nIt is believed to be luck bringing plant in china and it is widely grown in Asian countries. The variegated species of aglaonema differ in size, color, and pattern of leaves. \n\nimage source\n\n\nToxins or chemicals it removes: Benzene, formaldehyde\nCommon problems:\n\nAglaonema also shows yellowing when it is overwatered. So always water plants only when the top inch of the soil becomes dry\nMealybugs are common pests of aglaonema. Overwatering favors mealybugs infestation as they are attracted to wet conditions. They reside in nodes of leaves and damage the leaves. Wipe them with a damp cloth and spray neem oil to avoid further infestation. If leaves are already infected badly, remove them.\n\nCare tips:\n\nAglaonema leaves are very sensitive to direct sunlight. Leaves tend to scorch when kept in direct light for a longer time\nPlace the plant anywhere in a room if it is receiving the window light\nWhen maintained outdoors make sure you place it under a shrub/tree shade or anywhere(balconies, wall side) where it is receiving morning/ evening sunlight.\n\n \n4. Spider plant:\nIt is another fantastic air purifying plant that clears carbon monoxide (CO), which is very harmful when inhaled.  A pigment named haemoglobin that is present in our blood helps in carrying oxygen to all parts of our body. When we inhale CO, it prevents the flow of oxygen in the blood. At higher concentrations, this may even lead to death. Having a clump of spider plants helps in regulating the CO levels in our indoor air. \n\nimage source\n\n\nToxins or chemicals it removes: Carbon monoxide (CO), xylene.\n          As the baby plants produced on their long trailing stems look like spiders crawling down from the web, this plant is named spider plant. It has many variegated species and performs well even in low light conditions. You can grow this plant anywhere in your home like hall, bedroom, and even in your bathrooms.\nCommon problems: Browning of tips is the most common problem in spider plants that occur mainly due to water stress conditions. It may happen by both over and under watering. Over-fertilizing and too much sunlight may also lead to tip browning in spider plants.\n \n5. Peace lily:\nThese plants are believed to bring peace around. Peace lily is also known as Spath, it is named after its botanical name Spathiphyllum (genus). Spaths have spoon-like white flowers (spathes - modified leaves/bracts) which look so stunning and steal attention no matter where they are placed. \n\nimage source\n\n\nToxins or chemicals it removes: Benzene, xylene, toluene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene\nCommon problems:\n\nGreen flowers: Although flowers appear green in the early and later stages of their life span. Some flowers remain green all the time which disfigures the decent look of the plant.

In addition to growing these air-purifying plants, we should also follow some measures to reduce the emissions of these chemicals. Let’s take a glance.\n \nPreventive measures to reduce the emissions of harmful chemicals into the indoor air\n \n\nFirst and foremost measure is Quit smoking. As I already told u before, its smoke contains several carcinogens that pollute the air and your health as well. At least make sure that you don’t smoke in areas where people stay most of the time ex. Living rooms\nMaintain proper ventilation throughout your home\nUse natural cleaning products\nStrictly follow “no shoe policy” inside the home. And also ask visitors to leave their footwear outside. By this entry of unwanted pests and chemicals into the home will be reduced\nInvest in a good vacuum cleaner, that is capable of filtering small particles present in mats, carpets kind of utilities\n\nimage source.\nAvoid using deodorants, insect repellants, and pesticides (for plants) and get into organic ways.\nReduce the use of air conditioners. Because ACs also emit chemicals like chloro-fluoro-carbons (CFCs) which are very harmful to our health and environment\n\n\n \nFrequently asked questions:\n\n\nIs it harmful to have plants in bedrooms?Plants indeed release CO2 at night but those concentrations will not harm humans or any animals (pets). Plants release a very low amount of CO2 which is lower than even humans. So it is completely alright to maintain plants in your home. \n\n\nWhich plants are good for bedrooms?Plants that do better even in low light conditions like Pothos, Snake plant, Spider plant, Philodendron, Monstera, Rubber plant are more likely to be maintained in bedrooms.  \n\n\nWhich indoor plants release oxygen at night?Snake plant, Spider plant, Aloe vera, and Areca palm are some of the indoor plants that release oxygen at night. One can maintain these plants even in their bedroom to improve their sleeping and breathing issues.\n\n\nWhat is the major source of indoor air pollution?Burning of traditional fuels for cooking purposes is the main source of most of the indoor air pollution in the country. It is resulting in the deaths of millions of people annually. \n\n\nWhat are the major air pollutants?Particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOC), tobacco smoke, CO are some of the major indoor air pollutants.\n\n\nWhat are the major problems of indoor air pollution?Indoor air pollution leads to many problems which we neglect often. They are headaches, dizziness, nausea, respiratory problems, eye irritations, sore throat. At prolonged exposures of higher concentrations may also lead to cancers.\n\n\nDoes money plant grow better in soil or water?Money plants grow well both in soil and water. But it grows faster in soil when compared to water. Do not forget to change the water every week when grown in water.\n\n\nShould I cut the brown tips of my spider plant?Browning of tips occurs when the plant is exposed to too much sunlight or high humidity. It also happens due to over-fertilizing of the plant. You can cut the brown tips to make it look good but try to maintain the plant indoors or in shade (outdoors) and do not fertilize more than once a month to prevent your plant from tip browning.\n\n\nWhy is my pothos not growing?Sometimes pothos (money plant) shows poor growth or produce very few leaves which result in leggy stems with a wide gap between leaves. In that case, shorten the stems by cutting and add any of the organic fertilizer to enhance the growth of leaves.\n\n\nWhy is my aloe vera plant turning brown?It causes mainly due to\n\n\n\nOver/under watering: Water the aloe vera plant when the 3/4th part of the pot becomes dry.\n\nExposure to harsh sunlight: Browning of leaves is also a defense mechanism of the aloe vera plant to protect itself from the strong ultraviolet radiation. Shift the plant to partial shade or indoors so that it turns back to green again\n\nExcess salt concentration in the soil: In this case, repot the aloe vera into well-drained soil. Or you can also go for any of the succulent potting mixes that suit best for its growth.\n\n\n \n \n         \n Popular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot",

Vincas need some extra food at the time of growing and flowering periods, so consider the application of organic fertilizers after 45-50 days of sowing\n\nHow to take care of flowering plants\nPlant care is not an easy task when you are not aware of some basics. We all know some plant care basics like watering, weeding, pest, and disease management. But the flowering plants need more than these. Let’s know the basic flowering plant care practices in detail.\n\nProvide the flowering plants with adequate sunlight\n\n\nSunlight is the key source of the energy for plants to produce food. You need to provide enough sunlight for the flowering plants if you are hoping for a better outcome from them. Flowering plants are required to be exposed to direct sunlight at least for 7-8 hours every day. \n\nWater the flowering plants when they are in need\n\n\nSummer flowering plants may require regular watering as there will be excess evaporation due to the high heat. Water the summer flowering plants when the top 2-3 inches of the soil is dry. Don’t overwater the plants as the damp soil will lead to root rot and become the harbor for many fungal diseases.\n\nWater the soil directly\n\n\nWatering on the leaves might be the easiest way, but this watering habit can harm your plants. Overhead watering can increase the risk of fungal growth on the leaves and also affects the overall health of the plants. While watering, directly water the soil away from the leaves. Watering plants at the soil level provides the hydration right to the roots where it is needed and also reduces the risk of fungal diseases.\n\nAvoid over-application of fertilizers\n\n\nAlthough flowering plants need to be fertilized to get essential nutrients for their growth, the excessive application can harm them. Overapplication of fertilizers can decrease the growth of the plants instead of promoting their growth. The application of excessive fertilizers leads to stunted growth, burned leaf margins, and the death of the plants. So always feed the flowering plants with an appropriate amount of fertilizers.\n\nMulch the flowering plants\n\n\nThe high heat of the summer will lead to excess loss of moisture from the soil, so it will be difficult for the plants to get sufficient water. To reduce evaporation, mulching will be beneficial. Cover the soil surface with natural mulching materials. This helps the soil to retain the moisture for a longer time and also reduces the weed growth.\n\nKeep a check on pests and diseases\n\n\nPests and diseases are the common problems of plants. But you should not neglect their existence. Prevention is the key to managing pests and diseases. Regular weeding is a must in the garden as the weeds serve as a harbor for many pests. Avoid overhead watering to reduce the occurrence of fungal diseases. Removal and safe disposal of infested plant debris also helps to manage the problem-free gardens.\n\nPruning in the flowering plants\n\n\nPruning is the essential practice in flowering plants to promote more blooms. Prune the flowering plants after the flowering is finished but before the budding initiates. Pruning in summer flowering plants should be done in late winter or early spring.\n\nDeadheading in the flowering plants\n\n\nRemoving the dead flower heads from the plants is known as deadheading. Deadheading in the flowering plants allows them to produce more flowers. When you remove the old or dead flowers from the plants, the plants start to spend their energy and nutrients to produce new growth instead of spending on the old flowers. \n\nProvide your flowering plants with support\n\n\nSome weak stemmed flowering plants or plants with heavy clusters of flowers need a little bit more support to stand upright. Providing support with the help of stakes by driving them into the ground helps the plants to grow upright and also increase the flowering.\n\n  \nFAQs Related to Summer Flower Plants\n1. What are summer flowers?\nSummer flowers are the warm-season flowering plants. They prefer warm weather and longer days length for their growth. Summer flowers require full sunshine hours at least for 6-8 hours and warm soil temperature.\n2. Why some of the flowers are seasonal?\nSome flowers adapted to particular weather conditions to bloom naturally. They need ideal climatic factors such as sunlight, soil temperature, and humidity for their growth and development. Hence based on their adaptability, flowers should be grown in a particular season. \n3. What is the purpose of pruning in flowering plants?\nPruning is mainly done to remove unwanted plant parts and dead plant parts that are not requisite to growth. Pruning in flowering plants helps to maintain the plant in a proper shape and to optimize the blooms. \n4. How do we deadhead a flower?\nDeadheading in flowering plants is a very simple and essential technique. Just remove the faded or spent flower either with your hand or secateurs. This process gives the plant a clean appearance and also encourages the new bloom.\n5. What is mulching?\nMulching is the process of spreading a layer of material to the soil surface. This process helps to conserve moisture, improves soil fertility, and also suppresses weed growth.\n6. What type of materials can be used for mulching?\nYou can use commonly available organic materials as mulches in your garden. Organic mulching materials include fresh-cut forage, cocopeat, wood chips, leaves, and other crop residues. \n7. Why do plants fail to flower?\nFlowering plants can fail to bloom due to various reasons. Shade (inadequate sunlight) and insufficient moisture are the most common reasons for improper blooming. Other reasons include improper pruning and nutrient imbalance. \n8. How do you control pests in flowering plants naturally?\nTo keep your flowering plants pest-free naturally practice management practices like spraying neem oil at both the upper and lower surface of the leaves, avoiding overhead watering, and handpicking the pests. \n9. How do I encourage flowering in plants?\nPotassium promotes flowering in plants. Feed flowering plants with flower boosters that can provide an adequate amount of potassium to encourage flowering and plant them at the place where they can get the right amount of sunlight.\n10. Why do flower buds fall off before blooming?\nPremature bud drop occurs due to many different reasons including temperature fluctuations, water stress,  pests attack, and nutrient deficiency. To overcome this problem, keep the soil evenly moist, do not overfertilize the plants, and apply bone meal organic fertilizer.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colorful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot",

        "articleBody": "We have often heard that insects are harmful to plants. \nBut some of us are not aware of one such thing that not all insects found in the garden are harmful. \nYes, some of the insects are beneficial to plants and they actually help the plants in sustainable ways. \nIn this blog, you will know about major beneficial insects that are actually beneficial to plants and their importance in natural pest control. \nWhat are beneficial insects?\nBeneficial insects are insects that benefit the plants and ecosystem by performing different vital activities like pollination and natural control of pests. They are the effective service providers to keep the damage-causing pests in check naturally by feeding on them. So we can call them natural enemies of harmful pests. \nBeneficial insects are categorized into 3 types based on their way of approach to natural pest control and pollination as the following\n\n\n1. The Predators\n\nPredatory insects prey and feed on other insects for food.\nEg - Ladybird beetle, ground beetles, lacewings, spiders, aphid midges, syrphid flies, yellow jacket wasps, etc\n2. The Parasitoids\nAdult parasitoids are free-living insects and adult female parasitoids lay eggs inside or on the host insects. Due to this action, immature parasitoids develop within or on the host insects and eventually kill them. \nEg - Parasitic wasps, tachinid flies\n3. The Pollinators\nPollinators are the group of insects involved in pollination. They visit flowers to feed on nectar and carry pollen from the male part of the flowers (stamen) to the top portion of the female part of the flowers (stigma). Pollinators play a very crucial role in fruit and seed production in plants. \nEg - Honey bees, wild bees, butterflies, moths, and leafcutter bees\nList of beneficial insects for plants\nMany of us are aware of honey bees and butterflies as we often hear about them and see them in our garden. But many beneficial insects which rarely noticed by us are protecting our plants without our knowledge. Here is the introduction about major beneficial insects that are protecting plants from harmful pests.\n1. Ladybird beetles/Ladybugs\n\nYou may have observed these dome-shaped and bright-colored beetles on plants in the garden. Ladybird beetles are the natural predators of most destructive pests such as aphids, whiteflies, scales, mites, mealybugs, thrips, and other soft-bodied insects.\n                                                         \nBoth larvae and adults of ladybird beetles prey on the serious pests of plants. Larvae (immature form of an insect) feed on soft-bodied pests but they don’t feed on pollen and nectar. The feeding habit of adult ladybird beetles is similar to larvae, in addition to that, they also feed on nectar and pollen. One more interesting fact about the larvae of ladybird beetles is, they can feed on 40 aphids in an hour.\n 2. Ground beetles \n\nThe size, shape, and color of ground beetles vary from species to species. Most of them are dark brown to metallic black in color with a flattened hard body. Both adults and larvae of ground beetles are the ferocious predators of caterpillars, thrips, weevils, nematodes, slugs, and grasshopper eggs. Some specialized groups of beetles with hook-shaped mouthparts also feed on snails. Most commonly ground beetles prefer to live under barks of trees, among rocks, or under some low-growing plants to protect themselves from their enemies. \n3. Green Lacewings\n \n\nGreen lacewings are one of the excellent active predators that protect our plants from harmful insects throughout their growing season.  Larvae of green lacewings are beneficial to biological pest management in a wide variety of plants. At their larval stages, green lacewings are voracious feeders of most soft-bodied insects like aphids, mites, small caterpillars, mealybugs, immature whiteflies, and even eggs of some species. Larval green lacewings are popularly known as “aphid lions” because of their voracious predatory nature on aphids. \n4. Spiders\n\nYou might have noticed spiders among garden plants. But all of them are not beneficial to the plants. It is necessary to know how to distinguish between harmful and beneficial spiders.\n\nIt helps to eliminate harmful spiders and allows only beneficial predatory spiders to do their work. Among the spiders, only wolf spiders, sac spiders, orb-weaver spiders, and jumping spiders play an important role in controlling the populations of many harmful insects.\n\nThey feed on pests including aphids, wasps, beetles, mosquitoes, grasshoppers, and fruit flies throughout the growing season. \n5. Syrphid flies/Hoverflies\n\nAdult syrphid flies resemble honey bees in their looks. These yellow and black flies are often seen hovering above flowering plants and pest colonies, hence they are also known as hoverflies.\n\nAdult syrphid flies are efficient pollinators and they lay their eggs near pest colonies. The emerged syrphid larvae are the natural enemies. Larvae feed on aphids, scales, thrips, and other soft-bodied insects. Syrphid fly larvae look similar to pest caterpillars. The only difference is syrphid fly larvae do not have any legs whereas pests caterpillars have legs. \n6. Praying mantids\n \nYou have probably seen these eye-catching, triangular-headed insects in your garden before. Their bent and angled body posture make them look like they are praying, thus they are popularly known as praying mantids. Praying mantids are one of the most beneficial predatory insects and they feed on a wide range of pests like caterpillars, moths, beetles, gnats, and crickets. Sometimes female praying mantids feed on male praying mantids just after mating. This type of ecological interaction of consuming another individual of the same species is known as Cannibalism. \n7. Minute pirate bug\n\nMinute pirate bugs are one of the efficient predatory bugs that start hunting their prey early in the growing season. These oval-shaped, black and white bugs are most commonly seen during the warmest days of the autumn season. Both nymph (immature form of invertebrates, that resembles adult insects) and adults of minute pirate bugs feed on plant pests including aphids, spider mites, thrips, psyllids, whiteflies,  caterpillars, and also on insect eggs. \n8. Aphid midge\n\nAphid midges are one of the beneficial predatory insects. They are the most efficient and voracious feeders of 60 types of aphid species and their strategy towards aphid population check is more effective than green lacewings. An individual aphid midge larva can consume up to 65 aphids in a day. Adult female aphid midges usually lay their eggs among the aphid colony so that hatched larvae can get immediate food. Larvae of aphid midges paralyze the legs of aphids by injecting poison into the joints and then they consume them. \n9. Predatory mites\n \nPredatory mites are the best service providers you need for the natural control of spider mites. These pear-shaped tiny mites are similar to their prey spider mites in looks. But the only difference is predatory mites have long legs when compared to spider mites, this even helps them move faster than their prey. Adult predatory mites feed on spider mites, thrips, gnat larvae, and other pest mites. When there is no pest infestation, predatory mites feed on pollen and nectar without harming the plants. \n10. Tachinid flies\n \nTachinid flies are one of the world’s largest groups of parasitoidal beneficial insects. Although they are tiny in size, their service in keeping the pests in check is overwhelming. Tachinid flies somewhat resemble house flies in their looks but you can identify them by their spiny bristles. Most of the tachinid flies are internal parasites. Adult female tachinid flies can insert the eggs inside by piercing the host body and some lay eggs among the pest colonies. After the eggs hatch, maggots of tachinid flies get ingested into the body of the host while consumed by them and then maggots start to develop inside the host body. Eventually, they kill the host. They attack and feed on pests including caterpillars, grasshoppers, sawfly larvae, cutworms, adult and larval beetles. \n11. Parasitic wasps\n\nWe rarely notice the activity of parasitic wasps because of their tiny body. But their importance in biological pest control is immense. They are one of the beneficial insects that offer their efficient service in keeping the pests population in check including aphids, caterpillars, whiteflies, and dotted cucumber beetles.\n\nParasitic wasps lack an ovipositor, hence they can’t insert eggs inside the host body. Instead of that, they lay their eggs on plants that are eaten by their prey. Eaten eggs hatch inside the pest's body and eventually result in the death of the pest.\n12. Honey bees\n\nThere is no one who has not heard the name of the honey bees. Honey bees are the most popular hardworking beneficial insects in our ecosystem. They are beneficial to humans and plants in many ways. We all are well aware of their service in economically important honey and other hives by-products production. Apart from this, honeybees are the most important part of crop production. They play a very significant role in pollination. When honey bees visit the flowers to collect nectar and pollen, some pollens from the male reproductive part, stamen, stick to their hairy body and they transfer the carried pollen to the stigma, top of the female part of the same flower or different flower. This service of honey bees aids the reproductive success of plants. \n Importance of Beneficial insects in pest control\n\n\nBeneficial insects are efficient service providers in natural pest control. Here there is no interference of humans needed and this process will carry out by naturally existing beneficial insects. Beneficial insects feed on prey and help in keeping the pest population in check. This helps to reduce the loss of agricultural output in a significant way and also helps in increasing global crop production.\nBeneficial insects play a significant role in biological pest control. Here man uses the basic strategy of natural pest control by introducing and manipulating the predators and parasitoids purposefully to the agroecosystem to reduce the pest population.\nBeneficial insects offer us the chance to reduce the usage of chemical pest control measures and thus they help in building a sustainable ecosystem.\nSeveral destructive pests have developed resistance towards chemical pesticides, thus their population is not reducing even after using pesticides. But they can’t escape from the predators and parasitoids.\n\n How to attract beneficial insects to the garden?\n\n\nBroad-spectrum insecticides can kill a wide range of insects including beneficial insects. In order to protect their population in your garden, reduce the use of broad-spectrum insecticides and use less toxic organic pest controllers.\nIf you are using any insecticides, then consider spot spray only on infested plants, not on healthy ones.\nSpray neem oil or any other organic pest controllers early in the morning or in the late evening, when the insect's activity is low.\nFlowering plants attract beneficial insects to the gardens. Plant early blooming plants so that beneficial insects can start to visit your garden in the early growing season before any pest attack.\nGrow short-statured, shrub-like plants and tall statured plants in the garden. Beetles prefer shrubs or any short-statured plants to hide. Some insects like wasps, honey bees, butterflies, and others like to feed on nectar, so tall flowering plants offer them food.\nMulching the ground provide the preferable habitat to ground beetles.\nCreate a simple water source in the garden. This helps you to keep beneficial insects hydrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nFAQs Related to Plant Friendly Insects\n1. What are biological control agents?\nBiological control agents are the living organisms that are used to control the population of insect pests. Biological control agents include beneficial insects and microbial control agents such as Bt, viruses, and nematodes. \n2. What is the difference between plant pests and beneficial insects for plants?\nPlant pests are insects that are harmful to plants in many ways. Whereas beneficial insects are helpful in keeping the harmful pests in check and also helpful in pollination. \n3. What is the meaning of pollination?\nPollination is the process of transferring pollen from the male reproductive part of a flower (stamen) to the top of the female reproductive part of the same flower (stigma) or a different flower to aid the reproduction of plants. \n4. What is the meaning of host?\nThe host is an organism that is attacked by predators or parasitoidal organisms for food and shelter. \n5. What is the meaning of prey?\nThe prey is an organism that is being hunted and killed by another organism for food. \n6. Are earwigs beneficial?\nYes, earwigs are beneficial insects. They help the ecosystem by feeding on decaying plant residues and dead insects like aphids, mites, and nematodes. \n7. What are broad-spectrum insecticides?\nBroad-spectrum insecticides are synthetic insecticides that are specifically designed to control or kill a wide variety of insects when the specific insect that causes harm is unknown. \n8. How do I attract ladybugs to my vegetable garden?\nLadybugs prefer to feed on the nectar of the flowers. So consider growing brightly colored flowering plants like marigold, cosmos, and calendulas to attract them to your garden. \n9. What is Entomophily?\nEntomophily is nothing but insect pollination, which is a form of pollination where the insects are helpful in the distribution of pollen of plants. \n10. Why biological pest control is important?\nBiological pest control is a potential measure to reduce the pest population in the agroecosystem when compared to chemical pest control. It is very efficient and does not harm the environment like chemical pesticides. \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colorful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot",

Because summer is approaching India.\nSummer in India starts in the month of March and continues till May. Days are longer when compared to the nights in the summer. \nJust as some vegetables prefer the cooler temperatures of winter and spring, some vegetables prefer maximum sunlight and warm weather condition for their development. \nThe vegetables which prefer warm weather conditions grow well in the summer season. Hence it is the right time to learn about them. \nIn this blog, you will find out what to plant during this summer.\nWhat are Summer vegetables?\n\n \nSummer vegetables are the short-season crops commonly grown between Kharif and Rabi seasons. They are also known as Zaid crops. \nSummer vegetables prefer warm dry weather and longer days length for their vegetative and reproductive growth. \nThese vegetables require at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight and optimum soil temperature to grow really well. Hence the longer day length and warm temperature of the summer favors the flowering and fruiting in these vegetables. \nFor all of our gardeners, we listed the top vegetables that can be grown at your home during this summer.

Beans\nScientific name - Phaseolus vulgaris\nFamily - Fabaceae or Leguminosae\n \n\nFrench beans or common beans is one of the most consumed and widely grown vegetables in India. They are also known as green beans as they are consumed at their unripened stage. These are tender, small, and slightly curved fleshy pods with pointed ends. French beans are ideal to strengthen your immunity as they are a good source of Vitamin C, Vitamin B1, and B2. Beans are rich in fiber that help to regulate the digestive tract. \nSummer is just perfect to grow these vegetables as they require warm weather and higher soil temperature for their better production. \nHow to grow French beans\n\n\nSoil type - French beans can be grown in all types of soil, but it performs better in soil that is well-drained, fertile, and has higher infiltration rate. So generally loam soils are better to cultivate French beans\n\n\n\nSowing - Sow the seeds about ½-1 inch of depth by leaving 8-10 inches of space between the seeds. Transplantation is not appreciable in the case of beans as the roots are very delicate and are highly susceptible to transplant shock. So, sow the seeds directly into the soil\n\n\n\nSpecial care - If you are thinking to plant pole beans, then make sure to install trellis or stakes on the grounds to support the plants\n\n\n\nWatering - Water the soil thoroughly after sowing the seeds but avoid overwatering. Maintain the soil in even moist conditions especially during the fruiting and flowering stages. Avoid watering on the plant during flowering, this may cause flowers to fall off and also lead to diseases\n\n\n\nFertilizing - As beans are legumes, they can fix the nitrogen on their own with the mutual connection of soil nitrogen-fixing bacteria. So avoid feeding them with nitrogen-rich fertilizers. These vegetables can be fertilized with aged organic compost manures\n\n\n\nHarvesting - Beans will be ready to harvest 55-60 days from the date of sowing. Harvest the young and tender pods when they are about 3-4 inches long.\n\n\n2. Brinjal, also known as Eggplant or Baingan (in Hindi)\nScientific name - Solanum melongena\nFamily - Solanaceae \n\nBrinjal is growing worldwide for its outstanding fiber content and antioxidants. This delicate perennial plant is usually grown as an annual. Brinjal is popularly known as Eggplant as it bears egg-shaped fruits that are glossy, white to purple in color with white spongy flesh. Eggplants have been used in Ayurveda since ancient Indian times as medicines to treat diabetes and asthma. This warm-weather crop is a decent blend of potassium, fibers, antioxidants, and phytonutrients. \nHow to grow Brinjal or Eggplant\n\n\nSoil type - Brinjal plants perform better in sandy loam soil which is well-drained, well-aerated, and rich in organic matter with pH 5.5-7.2\n\n\n\n\nSowing - Sow the seeds in the holes about ½ inches of depth that are 15-20 inches apart directly into the soil. You can also transplant the seedlings to larger containers of at least 12 inches deep in case they are raised indoors. If you choose container gardening for eggplants, then make sure of planting smaller growing varieties\n\n\n\n\nWatering - Don’t let the soil dry out completely at the same time don’t overwater the plant. Water the soil regularly to maintain the even amount of moisture which ensures the better growth of the plant\n\n\n\n\nFertilizing - Fertilize the eggplants with aged organic compost manure and compost tea at the growing and fruiting stages to promote the healthier production of fruits\n\n\n\n\nHarvesting - The maturity period of brinjal is 100-120 days after sowing. You can harvest these vegetables just by looking at their skin color and size. A well matured and ready to harvest brinjal is firm with increased size and full-colored \n\n\n3. Bitter Gourd\nScientific name - Momordica charantia\nFamily - Cucurbitaceae\n\nAs its name suggests, the crunchy and watery flesh of this vegetable is bitter. Bitter gourd is a green-skinned vegetable with a rough exterior usually consumed cooked at the unripened stage. Though its taste is bitter, it is a favorite vegetable of many because of its outstanding health benefits. Bitter gourd is a rich source of potent antioxidants, polyphenols, fiber, and flavonoids which ensures overall health. \nWarm weather of summer and plenty of sunshine favor the growth of bitter gourd. \nHow to grow Bitter gourd\n\n\nSoil type - Bitter gourd prefer well-drained, well-aerated loamy soil with rich organic matter content for their better growth\n\n\n\n\nSowing - Sow the bitter gourd seeds about ½-1 inch of depth by leaving a distance of 18-22 inches between two plants. Direct sowing of seeds into the soil would yield well when compared to transplantation. Because stems of the bitter gourd plant are delicate hence are susceptible to transplant shock\n\n\n\n\nWatering - Bitter gourd requires evenly moist soil to thrive. Regular watering is very necessary in order to keep the soil moist without letting it dry\n\n\n\n\nSpecial care - Providing support with the help of trellis or stakes is necessary for  climbing vines of bitter gourd. Staking even helps in increasing the size of fruits and yield\n\n\n\n\nFertilizing - Application of organic compost manures and seaweed extract is appreciable at the growing and fruiting stages \n\n\n\n\nHarvesting - Fruiting in bitter gourd plants generally starts between 55-60 days from the day of seed sowing. The transition of skin color from green to yellow is very fast in bitter gourds. So start harvesting fruits once they reach 4-6 inches in length and when they have firm skin\n\n\n4. Cucumber\nScientific name - Cucumis sativus\nFamily - Cucurbitaceae\n\nCucumbers are widely cultivated in India for food and medicinal purposes. They are made of 96% water, thus they can help in relieving dehydration. Cucumbers are pepo types of fruits and they are decent sources of beneficial nutrients, antioxidants, and plant compounds. Cucumbers are low in calories, hence they are ideal for weight loss. \nThis summer, try growing cucumber at your home garden to adopt a healthy lifestyle.\nHow to grow Cucumber\n\n\nSoil Type - Well-drained and loosely packed soil with a good amount of organic matter is ideal for growing cucumber\n\n\n\n\nSowing - Sow the cucumber seeds at the depth of 1 inch in the soil and 4-5 inches apart. Once the seedlings reach the height of 3-4 inches, remove the weak plants and retain the strong plants spaced 10-12 inches. Direct sowing is beneficial when compared to transplanting as the stems are delicate. \n\n\n\n\nWatering - Regular watering is necessary to maintain the evenly moist soil always. Uneven watering or inconsistent watering leads to bitterness in cucumbers, so keep checking the mixture level and maintain evenly moist soil\n\n\n\n\nSpecial care - If you are growing vining varieties of cucumbers, consider setting up stakings or trellis to support the vines. Whereas staking is not required in the case of growing bush varieties of cucumbers\n\n\n\n\nFertilizing - Consider adding the aged organic compost manure during the crucial stages like vegetative growth, flowering, and fruiting stages. Side dressing with compost tea is also appreciable to fasten the growth\n\n\n\n\nHarvesting - Cucumbers will attain the maturity index between 60-70 days from the day of seeds sowing. Harvest the fruits when they are tender, firm, and dark green in color.  Leaving overmatured cucumbers on the plants suppresses new fruit formation, so harvest them at the right stage.\n\n\n5. Green Chilli or Hari Mirch\nScientific name - Capsicum annum\nFamily - Solanaceae\n\nChillies are one of the most commonly and regularly used essential ingredients in our Indian kitchen. Chillies are spices that add authentic flavor, color, and spice to dishes. Although chillies can be grown in all the seasons, summer is the best season to cultivate as they are warm-season crops. We know their flavor. But many of us are unaware of how beneficial they are for our health. Chillies are of zero cholestrol and contain a good amount of dietary fibers which is beneficial for diabetic people. They are a rich source of iron, antioxidants, beta carotene, and vitamins.\nHow to grow green chillies\n\n\nSoil Type - Well-drained soil with an enormous amount of nutrients and organic matter does wonder for growing chillies\n\n\nSowing - You can sow the seeds directly to the soil or also can start indoors for transplantation.         \n\n\nTransplantation - Start with the seed tray for better germination. Sow 2-3 seeds per hole and transplant the seedlings when they are 4-5 inches tall to the bigger pot of at least 12 inches deep or to the garden\n\n\nDirect sowing - Sow the seeds directly to the soil about ½ inches deep spaced between 12-18 inches. Thin out the weak plants if necessary to avoid the crowd\n\n\nWatering - Don’t let the soil dry. Dried soil leads to fruit and flower dropping in chillies so always keep the soil evenly moist. After the formation of fruits, water the plants frequently but don’t overwater\n\n\nFertilizing - Application of organic compost manures like bio organic manure, compost tea, and cow manure is appreciable at regular intervals. Don’t overfertilize with nitrogen-rich fertilizers\n\n\nHarvesting - Green chillies will be ready to harvest in 80-90 days. Harvest green chillies at the right matured stage. Fully ripened dried chillies can be used for the preparation of chili powder.\n\n\n6. Okra, also known as Lady finger or Bhindi (in Hindi)\nScientific name - Abelmoschus esculentus\nFamily - Malvaceae\n\nOkra or ladies’ fingers are warm-season vegetables that are perfect to grow in your garden this summer. They are heat-loving plants that require higher temperatures for flowering and pod development. Hairy pods contain numerous oval-shaped and white-colored edible seeds.

To encourage the even shape keep turning the fruits often with care. To promote the large size of fruits, allow 2 to 3 fruits to develop on the matured plant and remove the rest\n\n\n\n\nHarvesting - Pumpkins will be ready to harvest 70-95 days from the day of sowing. Harvest pumpkins when they are deeply colored with a hard rind and their vines have dried\n\n\nMajor diseases in the Summer vegetable garden\nIn order to protect vegetable plants from any diseases, it is important to learn to recognize those first. Let’s know what kinds of diseases are most common in vegetables this summer and how to control them. \nSome diseases in vegetable pants are caused by infectious pathogens like fungus, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes when the environmental conditions are suitable for them. Even adverse environmental conditions like uneven watering, soil compaction, nutrient deficiencies, and soil pH levels can cause diseases in plants. These types of diseases are referred to as physiological disorders. \nLeaf Blight\n\n\nLeaf blight commonly can affect the vegetable plants like melons, cucumber, pumpkins, and squash. This fungal disease is most commonly occurs in warm weather in late summer. Symptoms of infected plant leave initially occur on older leaves at the base of plants. Infected leaves of plants show patches of dull green or brown lesions and dry black-brown dry spots. \nPowdery Mildew \n\n\nPowdery mildew most commonly affects vegetable plants like beans, squash, cucumber, and okra. The upper surface of the infected leaves is usually covered with white to grey powdery growth. This causes stunted growth in plants and eventually leads to die back. \nDowny Mildew\n\n\nDowny mildew commonly can affect cucumber, squash, onion, and some other cucurbits also. Commonly infected leaves show irregular yellow to pale green spots on the upper surface and brown spots under surface. Underside leaf spots are covered with velvety grey mycelia. \nRoot-Knot Nematode\n\n\nHost plants include okra, squash, cucumber, beans, and tomatoes. The vegetable plants affected by root-knot nematode shows stunted plant growth, formation of large galls on root nodules of the plants, wilting, and reduced yields. \nDamping Off\n\n\nDamping off is a seed and soil-borne fungal disease that affects most vegetable plants. This majorly affects the young seedlings after healthy germination. In the majority of cases, plants will emerge normally without any symptoms but after some days they will wilt suddenly, become water-soaked and die. \nDisease management in vegetables\n\nFor the successful management of any disease, prevention is the key. Selection of disease-free seeds and disease-resistant varieties is essential to prevent the disease at the foundation itself\nEliminating the infected plant parts and plant residues as soon as they are recognized can help us to reduce the disease inoculums and to prevent further spread of the diseases to other plants \nAfter harvesting the plants, plow the soil to expose the pathogen eggs to the sun if any. This prevents soil-borne diseases\nMulch the soil with transparent polythene during the summer, this method heats the soil surface and reduces soil-borne diseases, soil pathogens, and weed seeds (Soil solarization process)\nAvoid watering on the surface of leaves and foliage as the wet plant parts are highly susceptible to pathogens\nHarvest the vegetables at the right stage. Do not let them overripe\nProvide vegetable plants with adequate water, nutrients, and light\nProvide adequate space between plants to avoid the crowd. This also ensures better air circulation\n\nKnowing what to plant this summer and how to take care of them is all you need to learn to have a productive summer vegetable garden. So we hope, in this blog you have got all the necessary information to grow your own summer vegetables. \nFAQs Related to Summer Vegetable\n1.

Indoor plants increase the performance of the work:\n\nImage source\nIn a research study, it is found that Indoor plants can improve concentration, productivity, and well-being by 47% and can also boost memory up to 20% when they are kept in offices. Let me explain to you how. Plants have attractive colors and these colors affect neurological pathway in our brain and each color affect our body and brain in different ways.\n\nThe green color helps in improving concentration, \nOrange- acts as a mood lifter, and\n Blue- increases productivity (performance).\n\nSo plants with these flowers/foliage might help you in different ways at your workplace.\n3. Indoor plants maintain the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels around us:\n       \n\nimage source\nBesides having refreshing aromas and different colors, indoor plants also help in maintaining the right balance between oxygen and CO2 around us. These levels mainly affect the functioning of our brain. We feel hard to concentrate and couldn't make the right decisions when CO2 levels are high around us. \n       \n\nimage source\nWe can see this type of situation in busy workplaces like hospitals, banks, or any other government buildings, as many people will be breathing under the same roof. However, oxygen released by indoor plants helps in balancing the CO2 levels in our bodies. This is the main reason why we feel so refreshing outdoors (at parks/lawns). But having plants indoors can give you such refreshing ambiance right at your place.\n By knowing all these precious benefits, world’s most successful companies started incorporating indoor plants, vertical gardening into their office designs for the well-being of employees and of course to create a refreshing and welcoming working environment for them.\n4. Indoor plants play a major role in places where there are no trees:\n            Image source\n\nIn the apartments, we can notice many indoor plants at receptions, lift areas, and also in closed areas like corridors, and staircases. We think that they are placed to give a good look, but the actual reason is, generally apartments are constructed across large areas where we hardly find any trees. In order to maintain the oxygen levels in those areas, they place indoor plants because they can perform well even in indirect and low light conditions.\nAreca palm, Hawaii ti plant, Aglaonema, Croton, Fiddle leaf fig, Cast iron plant, are some of the widely grown indoor plants in the apartments. \n5. Indoor plants role in removing toxins and pollutants from the air (air-purifying):\nMany indoor plants clear the harmful chemicals (benzene, formaldehyde, xylene, toluene, etc) that are very harmful both to us and to our environment. Other than CO2 they also help in reducing the concentrations of harmful gas like carbon monoxide.\n       \n\nImage sources\nAloe vera, Areca palm, Aglaonema, Zz plant, Snake plant, Peace lily, Broad lady palm are some of the air purifying plants that play a major role in reducing indoor air pollutions.\n6. Indoor plants can also grow in low light conditions:\nUnlike normal plants, some indoor plants can also grow in absolutely low light conditions. We can grow them even in our bedrooms because they don’t need much light for their growth and development.\n       \n\nImage source\nRubber plant, Spider plant, ZZ plant, Fiddle leaf fig, Money plant, Philodendron, Snake plant are some of the plants that you can grow in your bedrooms even if the rooms are not receiving any indirect sunlight (like a room has no window).\n7. The creeping nature of indoor plants can add beauty to our home:\nWe can grow the creeping plants in two fashions i,e. Climbing and hanging. They look so stunning in either way. The main attraction of these plants is just their green leaves which differ in size, shape, and patterns. They also differ in arrangements of leaves on their trailing stems. One must grow these plants to have an amazing experience of indoor gardening and of course to stay unique from others\n        \n\nImage source\nMoney plants, English ivy, Philodendron, Chain of hearts, String of pearls, String of bananas, Sedum burrito (donkey’s tail), are some of the examples of climbing and falling plants.\nGrowing trailing succulents like String of pearls/Donkey’s tail will definitely make you stand so unique among other people. So don’t miss out, growing these plants in your balconies/homes(near to window) where it gets direct sunlight for at least 5 hours (not harsh noon light).\n8. We can use indoor plants in home decoring: \nNow it’s time to talk about the most common perspective and widely known reason for growing and maintaining indoor plants. Although growing indoor plants have many prominent and appreciable reasons, many people maintain them just to add beauty to the places. But it is also completely true that they add a distinct look wherever they are placed.\n        \n\nimage source\n\nThere are many indoor plants that have beautiful foliage and flowers in many different shades. Even the same plant( species) in variegated forms look so different from each other. So that we can even go for variegated forms of just a few plants to decorate our entire home \nGrowing indoor plants is an inexpensive way of adding colors to your home rather than investing in costly paints and arts. Because these plants can turn any boring place into warm and welcoming with their eye-catching appearances.\nCroton, Aglaonema, Hawaii ti plant, Coleus, Fittonia, Wandering jew are some of the colorful foliaged plants. While Anthuriums, Violets, Kalanchoes, Begonias, are some of the colorful flowers which we can grow indoors near to any window.\n\n So these are some of the superior reasons to grow and maintain plants indoors. All these plants have their own specific importance. So these are some of the hard-to-kill plants. Most of these plants can be propagated by cuttings. You need not spend money to have them in your home. You can borrow cuttings from your friends/neighbours and can grow them easily.\nI hope you got an idea regarding the indoor plants under different categories. Most of these plants are easily available and it is also very easy to maintain these plants as they are not much prone to diseases and pest attacks. But yet we do face certain issues which are very common in the case of indoor plants. Let’s have a look into those plant problems and solutions.\n\nCommon problems that we encounter in growing indoor plants:\n﻿1. Yellowing of leaves:\n\n      \n\nimage source, image source\nYellowing is the most common problem which is seen in almost all kinds of plants like fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals. Among indoor plants, it is mainly seen in Areca palm, Aglaonema, Money plant, etc. There may be several reasons for it some of them are\n\nOverwatering or under watering the plant: Mostly leaves turn yellow due to over caring like watering them even when it is not needed\nRoot bounding also leads to yellowing as plant root will be under continuous pressure as there is no space for them to grow and absorb nutrients\nDue to the lack of chlorine/nitrogen\nDue to the lack of sunlight\nDue to fungal/bacterial infections. But this happens very rare.\n\n \n2. Browning of tips:\n        \n\n        image source, image source\nThis is not a common problem in all plants. But it is common in areca palm and spider plant. some of the reasons for brown tips in indoor plants are\n\nThis mainly happens due to over-fertilizing\nPoor quality of potting mix/soil (deficient in nutrients)\nOverwatering \n\n\n3. Sun scorching: \nThis mainly happens in indoor plants as they are not tolerant to direct sunlight or full sun conditions. Money plant, English ivy, Philodendron, Aglaonema, Peace lily, Ferns, Anthuriums etc are some of the plants that are more prone to sun scorching. Do not place these plants in direct sunlight as their sensitive leaves tend to scorch easily.\n4. Drooping of leaves:\n\nimage source\nIn most of the plants drooping of leaves happens due to under-watering but some plants tend to droop even when the soil moisture gets reduced. \nPeace lily, Boston ferns, Umbrella plant particularly comes under this category. They always need their soil to be moist (but not wet). Their leaves and stems start drooping immediately when the soil is slightly dried.\n5. Tip burns:\n \n\nImage source\n \nIn many indoor plants edges/borders of leaves tend to get dry, brown, and turn papery which appear like burnt. \n\nBurning of tips also happens due to over-fertilizing of the plant.\nIn rare cases, it happens due to the deficiency of calcium content in the potting mix or soil.\nSome times it may also happen due to chilling temperatures.\nIt is mainly seen in, sensitive and long foliaged plants like money plant, elephant years, aglaonema, \n\n6. Infestations of aphids &amp; mealybugs:\n      \n\nImage source, image source\nAphids and mealybugs are the most common problems in every garden. They weaken the plants by sucking sap that leads to stunted or improper growth in plants. They also make plants vulnerable to the attacks of pathogens like fungi, bacteria etc. Don’t neglect the early infestations as they can multiply very fast and damage the plants within just a few days.\nAphids mainly attack on new growth (leaves, stems, tips of plants) and are present in green, black, brown, and even in pink colors. While mealybugs reside in nodes, leaf bases, buds of flowers, fruits, and vegetable plants, and sometimes also on roots. mealybugs appear in cottony white/cream color and rarely in brown.\n\n\nSome tips and solutions to overcome these common problems of your indoor plants: \n\n\nWhenever you water the plants, water them thoroughly and let the water come out from drainage holes. Make sure that the top inch layer of the soil becomes dry between every watering. This reduces most of the problems like yellowing and browning of tips in plants because many problems arise by overwatering of plants.\nCheck for pests/ diseases whenever you purchase plants from a nursery. Examine the stems, leaves mainly the underside of the leaves as many pests reside over there.\nDo not transplant the nursery purchased plant immediately. Before transplanting, maintain the plant in your environment for 2 days to protect the plant from transplant shock.\nPrune the dead and diseased parts of plants regularly to maintain them healthy\nRemove the older leaves as they can act as shelter for pests.\nKeep a regular check on your plants for pests and diseases to control them at early stages.\nSpray neem oil to control the aphids and mealybugs as it is organic and doesn’t cause any harm to plants. \nFertilize your plants only in their growing seasons. Some plants like most of the succulents go dormant in winters. It is not ideal to fertilize them when they are in dormancy periods. Know the dormancy periods of your plants and fertilize them according to it.\nFertilize indoor plants once every 3-4 weeks (with any organic fertilizers) in their growing season. Do not ver fertilizing plants as they may lead to tip burns in the leaves.\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n1.

        "articleBody": "What is coco coir?\nCoco coir is the mesocarp (middle layer) of the coconut drupe which is a thick fibrous layer that is present between the outer layer and hard internal shell. This fibrous coir is widely used in many materials like mattresses, automobile seats, mats, brushes. Besides its use in the upholstery industry, it has also been dragged to the gardening world by recognizing its benefits. The small fibers and pithy dust of coco coir which were once thrown away are now put in usage and have a great demand too.\nImage source\nWhen it comes to gardening, coco coir is a very friendly product among green thumbs for various reasons. Coco peat is well known for its water retention capacity and is also an easily available water holding product when compared to other products (sphagnum moss) having the same function. It is an excellent soil amendment as it improves the physical properties of the soil. Although it doesn’t have an appreciable nutrient value, it improves the nutrient uptake by the plants. Some of the other benefits of coco coir/peat in gardening are mentioned below. \n\nUses of coco peat in gardening:\nAs a soil amendment, it improves soil structure and also adds organic matter to the soil.\nUnlike soil, through which excess water leaches below the root zone, coco peat helps in retaining water and also prevents soggy and waterlogged conditions at the same time.\nIt holds water around 7-8 times its weight and eliminates excess water.\nIt improves aeration and drainage for better growth of roots.\nIt also prevents nutrient leaching as it retains nutrients and releases them slowly to the plants. This helps in better nutrient uptake.\nCoco peat is a sterile and bio-degradable organic matter and is free of weed seeds and pathogens.\nThe coco peat that is used for gardening generally has a low EC and pH of around 5.5 to 6.8.\n\nDifferent coco coir products: \nCoco coir is used in many ways by molding it into many different forms or products. These coir products help in easing gardening and give you a better experience. Some of such products are \n\n1. Loose coco peat2. Compressed coco bricks 3. Coco discs4. Coir pots5. Coir mulch mats6. Coir climbing Poles7. Coir planter liners8. Coco chips\n \n1. Loose coco peat: \nImage source\nLoose coco peat is readily available in any of the nurseries around you or you can also get in online. It exists in hydrated form. Make sure you purchase it from authenticated sources as there may be any unwanted additives to increase its weight or volume. Uses of coco peat in gardening.\nHow to use coco peat in gardening:\na) For container gardening:Prepare your own potting mix by mixing soil, compost, and coco peat in equal proportions. Or 35% coco peat, 40-45% soil and 20 - 25% compost.\nYou can also mix coco peat with compost alone until it reaches a 1:1 ratio. But adding it with both soil and compost is recommended to avoid nutrient leaching as compost is rich in nutrients. \nb) In gardens: Coco peat can be incorporated into the soil by slightly ploughing the planting area in your garden. This improves the soil structure and adds organic matter to the soil.\nc)For germination:Coco peat alone can be used to germinate seeds in the germination trays. It can be otherwise called a seed starting mix.\nImage source\nd) Bedding material:It can be used as bedding material/substrate in activities like vermicomposting, mushroom cultivation etc.\ne) For mulching:Coco peat is also a great mulching material that prevents water loss from the soil or any material. It can be spread as a layer on land, potted plants (upon soil), compost heaps to reduce the moisture losses from them.\nf) In hydroponics: To use the coco peat in hydroponics, it should be washed properly. Wash the coir with continuous running water to get rid of chemicals or salts if present. After that you can use it in hydroponics by mixing it with clay pebbles and fertilizers to ensure the better growth of plants.\n \n2. Compressed bricks:\n\nSmall fibers/coir are compressed and molded into different shapes to make them into hard bricks. The size and shape of these marketing bricks may vary to meet the different requirements. They are in dry and compressed form to supply a large amount of coco peat in less surface area. It should be hydrated with water so that they expand many times more than its volume to provide a loose virgin coco peat in powder form. This process of hydrating the coco coir block is known as reconstitution.\n \n\n\nReconstitution of coco brick:\n\nPlace the coco brick in a large tray or tub. Now slowly add water by turning the brick. Ensure you are hydrating the brick from all sides. Coir bricks can grow up to 15 times the size of their original form.\n\nNow let the brick sit for 5-6 minutes.\n\n\nLoosen the expanded coco peat and continue adding water to the remaining dry brick. Continue the process until the whole brick got expanded.Image source\n\nThe coco peat needs to be just damp so add water as per the instructions mentioned in the respective product description.\n\nReconstitution results in loose coco peat and then it can be used in many ways just as mentioned above (under loose coco peat).\n \n3. Seed starter coco discs:\n\nThese are other forms of coir products that are specially designed to germinate seeds, a reason why they are called seed starter coco discs or coco pellets. Coco peat or coco peat with potting mix is dried and compressed into circular discs, those which vary in diameters when hydrated. They come with netted or soft woven cloth around them that holds the coco peat together when expanded. when the seedlings are ready for transplantation, you can directly place the plant without removing it from the discs as the cloth enclosing the coco peat permits the growth of roots through it.\n\n\n\nReconstitution of coco discs: \nAdd warm to normal water as mentioned, to hydrate the coco discs. This results in an expansion of coco discs up to the height of 3 - 5 cms bags.\nAdvantages:\n\nTrustBasket’s Seed Starter Coco Discs are enclosed with bio-degradable non-woven cloth and they expand up to a height of 5 cm when hydrated.\nNetted/woven cloth acts as a pot to facilitate the sturdy germination of seeds in the expanded discs.\n\n4. Coir pots:\nLike any other pots, coco coir is also molded and pressed to form coir planters. Like plastic/ceramic pots they also exist in different sizes and shapes to fulfill the space requirement of different plants of your choice.\nImage source\nAdvantages of coir pots over other pots:\nCoir pots are bio-degradable and can be used both indoors and outdoors.\nCreate well-drained conditions for plants. \nRetain moisture for a long time.\nEnsure better aeration for the healthy growth of roots.\nYou can directly transplant the plants into your garden along with the coir pots as they ensure the growth of new roots through them and degrades gradually over time.\n\n\n5. Coir mulch mats: \nIt is a well-known fact that coco coir is also used as a mulching material to restore moisture in the soil for a longer period. To facilitate the better mulching process, coco coir is now pressed in the form of mats. These mats can be spread on the top of the soil easily. As the coco mulch mats are very porous you can even water plants even when these mats are spread on the soil.\n\nImage source\nAdvantages:\nHighly advantageous in summers.\nAvailable in different sizes according to the pot size. Placing and removing of these mulch mats is very easy.\n 6. Coir climbing poles/stands: \n\nLike moss sticks, climbing poles are also designed using fibers of coco coir to support the climbers. They also hold the moisture for a long period and nourish the aerial roots of vining/climbing plants. They also provide mechanical support to plants.\n\nImage source\n \nHow to use coir climbing poles:\nPlace the coir climbing pole in the middle of the pot with soil and now plant any climbing plants around it. Keep tying the growing climbers to poles to support them. Water the coir pole regularly to maintain them moist. or\nPlace the climbing poles in already potted plants and tie their stems along the length of the poles. Water the coir poles regularly to maintain them moist.\n Advantages:\nImage source\nProvides mechanical support to plants\nNourish aerial roots, so that they also absorb water to support the healthy growth of climbing stems.\nExists in different heights to support most of your plants.\n\n7. Coir planter liners: \nCoir planter liners are made of several layers of thick coir fibers that are pressed together to prevent the loss of soil through them. They can be fixed in any metallic wire baskets/window boxes.\nImage source\nImage source\nAdvantages: \nThey are not spongy like the peat moss ones.\nThey also come in different sizes and shapes according to the planters they are designed to line.\n8. Coco chips: \nImage source\nCoco chips of different sizes are made from both exocarp and mesocarp or only mesocarp of coconut drupes. They exist in different sizes and shapes. They are mainly manufactured to serve as mulches while some are also used in potting mixes to improve the aeration and drainage in the growing media.\n\n\n Frequently asked questions:\n\n1. How to use coco peat in gardening?\nCoco peat can be used in many ways in gardening. They can be used as\n\n\n\nSoil amendment\nMulch\nConstituent in potting mix\nMedia for germination\nMedia/constituent in hydroponics.\n\n\n \n2. Can we mix coco peat with soil?\nYes, you can mix coco peat in the soil to grow plants. It makes the soil well-aerated and well-drained. It also prevents water logging conditions and thus helps in the prevention of root rots.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Can we grow plants using coco peat and compost?\nYes. you can grow plants using coco peat and compost in a 1:1 ratio but there will be leaching of nutrients as compost holds excess nutrients. so we recommend you to make a potting mix using soil (35-40%), compost (20-25 %), coco peat (35%) to make use of all the goodness of both coco peat and compost nutrients.\n\n\n\n\n4. Can we grow plants in coco peat alone?\nNo, coco peat is an excellent soil amendment and constituent but it doesn’t hold appreciable nutrients in it. So do mix the coco peat with soil and/or compost to make a better growing media for plants. However, coco peat alone can be used to germinate seeds.\n \n5.

        "articleBody": "Every year in the winter season, many animals slow down their activity and find a safe place to stay. \nThis is Hibernation, the survival strategy of the animals to cross through the unfriendly season. \nBut does this only happen in animals? \nNo, it also happens in plants. \nYes, plants also take the advantage of this winter season to avail the rest as much as needed. \nPlants also go dormant to pass through unfavorable weather conditions for their regrowth. \nDormancy is the plant’s way of survivability in order to regrow each year. \n\nPlant Dormancy \n\n\nPlant dormancy is a period of seized plant growth. Dormancy is an approach that plants exhibit to survive. Just like us plants are also affected by the adverse weather conditions that winter brings. Due to the lower, freezing temperature, dry weather, shorter day length, and low humidity plants exhibit signs of little growth or no growth. Instead of using their energy to grow, plants seize their growth and development to retain energy to regrow until the favorable weather returns.\nWhy do plants undergo dormancy in winter?\nSunlight and temperature are the two main factors that influence the growth of plants. The sunny weather of summer provides the required amount of light and temperature, but the weather of the winter season is totally different, it’s not like summer. \nIn winter, the sun travels through the shortest path hence the days are shorter and the nights are longer. As the daylight reduces, so does the growth of the plants. This is an indication that your plants are heading towards dormancy. \nIf the plants continue to grow in winter, the water stored in their parts would freeze and can cause damage. In addition to all these, the frozen water in the ground, making it difficult for plants to collect water and to meet their requirements during cold weather. So the plants go dormant, there they put a stop to their active growth and conserve that energy to regrow until the desirable weather returns. \nHow does plant dormancy work?\nDuring winter, each plant is transformed differently. Whatever the plants do in winter, it is their approach to survive in unfavorable weather conditions. Signs of dormancy vary from plant to plant.\n         \n\nSome plants shed their leaves to retain the water they had stored during summer \nAs the sunlight and temperature drop during winter, lawns eventually stops growth and turn brown\nAs the weather conditions are not optimal at this time, seeds may stay weeks or months away from germination\n\n\nIs it necessary to make plants go dormant?\nAlmost all plants undergo dormancy on their own as this is very crucial for their survivability during winter. But the annuals are exceptions here, as they complete their lifecycle within a year, they don’t undergo dormancy. So, normally it is not necessary to make it manually in the case of outdoor perennial plants. But some potted and indoor perennials may need your help. \nMost of the plant’s growth will start to decline as the cooler temperature approaches during winter and they enter into a dormancy state. In the case of houseplants, it may help if you move them to cooler and darker places of your home. Darker and cooler places allow them to go dormant.\nSome outdoor potted plants need to be moved indoors during winter to make them go dormant according to their types and climatic requirements. Before bringing them indoors, acclimating them to the environmental changes is very important as the light and humidity vary between outdoors and indoors. \nHow to acclimate your houseplants?\nIn the initial days of acclimatization, bring your plants indoors in the evening and move them back outdoors in the morning for a few days. Gradually allow them to spend more time indoors overtime during this process.\nHow to know if the houseplants are dormant?\nSometimes you may fail to find out whether your houseplants are actually dormant or dying. So, if you are not sure then it is better to know them thoroughly with some set of tests.  \nThere are 3 simple tests, through them, you can find out about the dormancy of plants easily.\nSnap test\n\n\nSelect the end of a branch or a stem of your houseplant about 9 - 10 cm in length, then hold that part and bend it back sharply. If it’s dead, it will snap easily without putting much pressure, and the inside portion will be dry. \nIf it’s alive and under dormancy then the selected branch or a stem bends easily and after it splits into two pieces, you will see the green and moist portion inside. \nScratch test\n\n \nImage source\nSelect a branch on a young stem and scratch the surface of the bark either by using a knife or by your fingernail. If the inside portion is green, then it’s alive and it’s under dormancy, if not continue the process down to the stem. If you see a brown at each scratched portion, then consider it is dead.\nInspection of roots\n\n\nSometimes a dormant plant looks dull and dead above the soil surface, but it will have healthy roots inside. Try to remove the plants from their pots and check whether the roots are healthy or rotten and shriveled up.\nHow to care for dormant plants in winter?\nKnowing what to do and what not to do for your dormant plants in winter is very important. You need to change some of your plant care routines in winter to prepare them for spring.\nPause repotting\n\nAvoid repotting your houseplants during winter. As the plants are dormant in winters, they may not recover quickly.\nAvoid fertilizing\n\nAs the plants are in the resting phase in winter, they focus on living with what they have. If we provide extra food to the plants, they will not use it and it can disturb their natural growth cycle. So it is better to avoid fertilizing them.\n         \nReduce watering\n\nWinter means the shorter length and the shorter day length means a lower rate of photosynthesis. Plants need much water during their active growth but not here. So, instead of watering blindly, do check how the soil feels. If it is moist, do wait for a couple of days to give water. But when you water, water the plant thoroughly.\nMulching\n\nMulching can help to retain the moisture in the soil. It prevents moisture from evaporation and thus helps in keeping the soil moist even in the dry season. Mulching also helps to prevent damage to the roots due to the cold weather of winter.\n          \nKeep your plants away from heaters \n\nIf you reside in a place where winter temperatures fall below 15°C, then move your plants away from the direct air draft from heaters and windows.\nMove your plants together to create warmth\n\nTo create a humid microclimate, move your plants together out of the direct cold and dry winds. This helps your plants to stay warm and humid.\nDo check for any pests\n\nAs the plants are in lower humidity levels, the leaves become the best resident site for many pests. So do check for the pests such as spider mites, aphids, and scales underside of the leaves. If you find any wipe them off or spray neem oil.\nHow to Retrieve a dormant plant?\n\nPlants can take a couple of days or weeks to come out of dormancy after winter. In spring, they start new growth. To retrieve the dormant plants, you can bring back them to the place of indirect sunlight, water them thoroughly and fertilize them to boost their new growth. If you are going to keep the outdoor potted plants back to their places, then wait until the freezing temperature or frost got over.\nIn winter it is very normal to notice so many changes in your plants. But don’t worry, they are just exhibiting their strategy to pass through this cold weather and are preparing themselves to grow again. A little bit of your care can do a lot for your plants to stay happy and humid in their resting period. \nFAQs on Dormant Plants\n\n1. What is plant dormancy?\n\nDormancy is a state of seized plant growth in winter. In unfriendly weather conditions, plants seize their growth and development to conserve their energy instead of exerting it to grow, until the favorable weather returns.\n \n2. Why do plants go dormant in winter?\nWe all know that sunlight is ideal for every plant’s growth. But in winter the days are shorter and the nights are longer, hence the daylight reduces. In this situation, if the plants continue their growth, the stored water would freeze and can harm the plants. So they go dormant in winter.\n \n3. What triggers dormancy in plants?\nIn winter the days are shorter and nights are longer as the sun travels through the shortest path. A shorter day length results in reduced sunlight. Reduced daylight and the cooler temperature of the winter are the two factors that trigger the dormancy of plants.\n \n4. Do all plants go dormant?\nAs the resting period is very crucial for plants’ survivability during winter and to regrow, almost all plants go dormant irrespective of outdoors or indoors. But annuals don’t go dormant, because these are capable of growing only for a single season.\n \n5. How can we tell if the plant is dormant?\n\nYou can check by bending an end of a branch or a stem of the plant if it snaps easily and the inside portion is dry, then consider the plant is dead. If it’s alive, then the branch will bend easily and split into pieces. There you will see the green and moist portion.\nScratch the surface of the bark of the selected young stem. If the inside portion is green, then the plant is alive. If not continue the process down to the stem. If you find a brown and dry portion then consider it is dead.\nRemove the plants from their container and do check the roots, whether they are healthy or rotten and shriveled. Because sometimes even a dormant plant looks dull above the surface.\n\n \n\n6. Should we water the plants during their dormancy?\n\nDormant plants do not need frequent watering as they don’t show active growth during their dormancy. So avoid watering blindly and do check for the moisture level of the soil, if it’s dry then water the soil thoroughly, if it is not avoid watering.\n \n7. Should we feed/fertilize the plants during their dormancy?\nFertilizing the plants during their dormancy is not a good idea. In winter most plants seize their growth and they don’t show any active growth. So they don’t need extra food. \n \n8. Are hibernation and dormancy the same?\nPlant dormancy is the resting period of the plants in winter. There the plants seize their growth to cross through the adverse and unfavorable weather conditions.\nWhereas hibernation is an inactive state, there the animals slow down their metabolic activity to save energy and survive by eating less as the food is scarce in winter.\n \n9. What happens to the plants when they enter dormancy?\nSome plants will slow down their growth, some will stop their growth and blooming when they enter dormancy. Leaves of the dormant plant may turn yellow and they may droop.\n \n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colorful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot",

        "articleBody": "Gardening is a versatile hobby and also a healthy one. Growing a wide variety of plants in the backyard of your home is just an amazing experience we all can have. Gardening requires some skills and techniques. Some of them would be fun but some can make you feel guilty. \nGrowing plants from seed is a great way to start gardening. But when the raised seedlings attain a certain height, transplanting those babies is a bit of a complicated phase.\nTransplantation \nIt is the process of relocating a plant from one location to another location. It is an important event in every plant’s life, sort of like moving to a new house. But it is not as easy as it sounds. It can be a stressful experience for plants. Here, we are using the term “Transplant shock”, understanding the meaning of this may help you to find ways to avoid and cure it.  \n\nTransplant shock \nWhen you move a plant from its place to another, it’s a bit like a shock to them as they never expected this sudden relocation of their home. Newly transplanted plants won’t have an extensive root system. As the roots are disturbed, they can’t carry out their regular activities such as absorption of water and nutrients. So, this results in higher chances of susceptibility to outside injuries, pests, and diseases. \n\n Major causes of Transplant shock\n\nThere are several factors that influence the transplant shock in plants, some of the most common are:\n\nPoor or injured root system - Transplanted plants do not get well established as they have poor or injured roots. Such plants are very weak and more sensitive to other stress factors\nImproper planting - Planting depth also plays a major role here. Deep planting causes suffocation of roots, while shallow planting causes more root stress\nIf you put the plant in a container, due to lack of sufficient space roots may be unable to spread\nProper watering after transplanting is very important\nConsidering the plant’s growth habit, climatic requirements, and soil also plays a major role\nExposure of the roots to the air allows the tiny invisible rootlets to dry and die off\nThe plant that has been transplanted from its original place loses half or more of its root and production system\nCompanion plants of the new environment also influence the transplanted plants to some extent \nSoil type - Even in the same garden soil type differs from one corner to another. One side of the corner may have clay soil while another may have humus-rich, well-drained soil.\n\n\nSigns of Transplant shock\n     \n\nThe most common sign of transplant shock is leaf scorch of recently transplanted plants. Leaf scorch results in bronzing or yellowing of the tissue present along the leaf margins\nSignificant reduction in the plant’s growth and brown wilted leaves that droops drastically\nShortened internodes, which can result in shortened branch tips\nSometimes plants that are suffering from transplant shock result in leaf rolling or leaf curling. \n\n\nWays to prevent Transplant shock\nMost of us do not consider transplant shock as a major issue. But this may result in losing maximum plants in further stages of their growth. So, it is better to take some preventive measures before transplanting. \n         \n\n\nThe best time of the year to transplant your plants is at the beginning of spring or the end of the fall season. These two seasons provide the best conditions for transplantation\nTime of day in which you transplant your seedlings can affect the further growth of your plants. Since the roots are disturbed, they may fail to face the stress of water loss during hot sunny weather. Transplanting on a cloudy day or in the late evening will help to prevent much water loss and wilting, as there is minimum exposure to sunlight. So, plants will get enough time to adjust to the new environment without any transplant shock\nTry not to disturb the roots much while taking plants out of the container. Because there is a higher probability of root ball getting disturbed\nConsider the geographical area, soil type, and drainage where the plants are being transplanted\nWater the plant before transplanting. It keeps the root ball moist, so there will be fewer chances of roots getting disturbed\nTry to take out as many roots as possible. Because the tiny roots in the root ball are very necessary for the healthy growth of the plant\nWatering immediately after transplanting, makes the plant adjust it to the new environment \nRemove if any dead bark, dried leaves, and foliage of the plants which are being transplanted \nObserve newly transplanted plants regularly if there are any pests and disease infestations as they are too susceptible for them.\n\n\nWays to minimize Transplant shock\nEven with all the precautions, Some of the plants may undergo transplant shock. No worries, there are some measures that help the plants to overcome this situation. \n\n\nAdding some sugar to the soil of the transplanted plant helps to recover it from transplant shock. Dilute sugar in plain water, mix the solution thoroughly and apply it to the root zone of the plant\nTrimming back in the transplanted plants allows it to save more energy rather than spending it on old plant parts. Trimming helps the plant to focus on regrowth, this encourages quick recovery\nAlways keep the roots moist to prevent the rootball from drying out. It will fasten the reestablishment of the plant to its new home \nGive your transplanted plant some time to recover. Recovery time may vary from plant to plant. So, the care and time you give can help the plant to come back on its own.\n\nHope you understood that, prevention is better than cure even in the case of plants. Taking a few more preventive measures would help your plants to refrain from transplant shock. Even after following all these preventive measures, if your plants undergo any stress, then you have curing measures. So, always enjoy the gardening and endure the beauty of mother nature.\nFAQs About Transplant Shock \n1. What are the signs of transplant shock?\nBronzing or yellowing of the tissue present along the edges of leaves, brown wilted leaves that droops drastically, and stunted growth of the recently transplanted plants.\n2. Generally, how long does it take for a plant to establish after transplanting?\nRecovery time may vary from plant to plant. It depends on the age, type of the transplanted plant, soil type, and climatic condition of the planted location. In the seedlings stage, it will take up to 2-3 weeks, but in matured plants or trees, it will take up to years.\n3. When is the best time to transplant plants?\nIf you are planning to transplant any plant on a sunny day, then drop the idea. It will harm your plant. So, choose any cloudy day or late evening to move your plant from its place. \n4. Which is the best time of the year to transplant plants?\nTransplant the plants at the beginning of spring or the end of the fall season of the year. Because the cool air temperature of these two seasons helps the recently shifted plants to survive the shock.\n5. Why it is important to water the plant immediately after transplanting?\nWatering immediately after the transplanting keeps the root ball moist, this will help it from drying out and further root damage. Watering also helps in quick recovery from transplant shock.\n6. Can plants survive transplant shock?\nYes, plants can survive transplant shock with proper care. Be patient, give some water, and time to them. They will recover.\n7. Is it normal for plants to wilt after transplanting?\nYes, it is a commonly seen sign of transplanted shock. While transplanting there is a probability of roots getting damaged. Due to this stress, they fail to absorb sufficient water. This results in wilting of leaves.\n8. Can we give more water to the transplanted plants?\nToo much watering is not good for recently transplanted plants. They want the water to keep their root ball moist but not wet as it can be more stressful.\n9. How to revive plants from transplant shock?\nTrimming back of old, dried leaves and foliage, adding some sugar to the root zone, and keeping the root ball moist always helps your plants to fasten their recovery.\n10. Does sugar water help the plants to overcome transplant shock?\nYes, adding a little amount of sugar solution to the plant’s root zone would help in increasing the new growth of the transplanted plants. But, make sure you are not adding much as it results in reverse osmosis, which makes the plant lose water. \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colorful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot\n\n",

This can be a healthy and inexpensive winter vegetable choice for you. Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) belongs to the family Brassicaceae. By providing a space in your winter vegetable garden for this, you can enjoy the spicy taste and crunchy texture of raw cabbage or the sweetness of cooked cabbage.          \nCabbage is not only a tasty vegetable but also an exceptionally healthy one. It has an outstanding nutrient profile and is especially high in vitamin C and vitamin K. With so many potential health benefits, it is easy to see why cabbage deserves some space in your winter vegetable garden.  \nTips to Grow Cabbage\n\nChoose well-drained potting soil with rich organic matter\nYou can either raise your plants from seeds or transplants, but while availing seeds and transplants focus on the variety and growing conditions\nSow cabbage seeds at ½ inch depth and 1 inch apart\nAfter germination thin plants to 18-24 inches apart \nAlways keep the soil moist but not wet and do not overwater the plants\nYou can feed cabbage plants with organic nutrition supplements such as organic manures and vermicompost.  \n\n\n \nPalak ( Spinach )\n\nSpinach is an annual, winter-season, green leafy vegetable. The leaves and tender shoots are edible. These can be consumed fresh or processed. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is a superfood that belongs to the family Amaranthaceae. It is loaded with tons of nutrients in a low-calorie package, hence it is everyone’s favorite dietary green leafy vegetable. Dark, leafy green spinach is important for skin, hair, and bone health. Spinach is one of the best plant-based sources of iron and is also rich in health-promoting compounds such as Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, and flavonoids.\nGrowing spinach is very easy at home, the Indian winter season is just perfect for it.\nTips to Grow Spinach\n\nChoose the well-drained growing media that is rich in organic matter \nSow spinach seeds ½ inch deep into the soil with at least 3 - 4 inches of space between seeds. Once they reach a height of about 2 inches, thin the plants to provide sufficient space for their growth\n Spinach needs at least 3-4 hours of sunlight. As spinach grows well in cold weather, maintain the soil in moist condition but not wet, so avoid overwatering \nSpinach will be ready to harvest within a short period of 45-50 days from the day of sowing \nYou can get multiple harvests if you leave the crown to grow back, it is possible to get 3 to 4 harvests from each plant. \n\n \nCarrot\n\nDaucus carota is a popular root vegetable, typically orange in color and other cultivars are varying in color, texture, shape, and length. The edible part of the plant is a taproot. Carrot is a biennial plant that belongs to the family Apiaceae. These vegetables are highly nutritious and tasty too. Carrots are the richest source of beta-carotene, which is a potent antioxidant that benefits your brain, skin, lung, and eye health. This is probably the best-known superpower of carrots.\nTips to grow Carrot\n\nLoose, permeable, sandy soil is best for carrots. Planting carrots in compact soil will restrict the proper downward growth of their roots \nYou can plant these vegetables either on the ground or in containers. But make sure the container is at least 12 inches deep\nSow the seeds about ½ of an inch deep and 2 inches apart to reduce overcrowding\nOnce the seedlings are about an inch tall, thin out the plants so that the plants are 3-4 inches apart\nWhile harvesting make sure to harvest them at the right stage. Early harvesting may result in bland and flavorless carrots\nOnce they have reached a mature size, the tops will start to push out of the ground. If you can see the carrots on the top, it's time to consider harvesting.\n\n \nOnion\n\nOnions are the most popular, basic ingredient in every kitchen all around the world. We can say Indian cooking is almost incomplete without the use of onion. There is almost no delicious gravy, hot soup, or other dishes that are made without onions. Onion ( Allium cepa ) is a herbaceous cold season plant that belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae. The onion is an edible bulb made up of fleshy modified leaves. The leaves of onions are yellowish, to bluish-green in color. The onion leaves are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side.\nOnions not only cause watery eyes but also provide health benefits. These are packed with Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, manganese, potassium, antioxidants, and phytonutrients.  Make them a part of your winter vegetable garden to avail of the health benefits including weight loss, lowering the risk of cancer, healthy hair, and glowing skin.\nTips to grow onion\n\nOnions grow well in full sunlight and well-drained fertile soil\nOnions can be planted from sets, transplants, or seeds\nIf you are planting sets, bury them one inch under the soil and 2-6 inches apart\nWhen you transplant your seedlings, place at least 6 inches apart\nIf you prefer seeds to grow onions, then sow the seeds at ½ an inch depth and 1 inch apart. Later thin to 4 inches apart. The plants you remove while thinning from a row can be used as green onions\nYou can harvest onions at any stage. If you want a completely matured onion, then harvest when the tops are brown and naturally fall over\nThe soil needs to be moist but with no standing water. Poor drainage can cause root rot of onions.\n\n \nCauliflower\n\nA cruciferous vegetable, Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) is one of the most important vegetable crops of India. It is a sun-loving, cool-weather crop that bears large rounded leaves and an immature inflorescence (cluster of flowers) that is  “curd”, the edible part. Cauliflower is naturally high in fiber and Vitamin B. It is also rich in antioxidants and phytonutrients that can give protection against cancer. It also contains fiber to enhance weight loss, digestion, and choline, which is essential for mood, memory, recall, and many other essential nutrients.\nTips to Grow Cauliflower\nYou may have felt that it is a difficult job to grow cauliflower in your garden. That's only because it has some specific requirements that need to be met. But it’s not difficult once you know what it likes.\n\nChoose fertile soil enriched with organic matter which can hold moisture for a long time to prevent “Buttoning”. (Buttoning is a physiological disorder of cauliflower, is identified by the development of small curd)\nSow cauliflower seeds at ½ inch depth and 2 - 3 inches apart\nCauliflower requires moist soil for robust growth and healthy head formation\nWhite cauliflowers should be blanched to keep the head white and to protect the head from rain and too much sun. While green, orange, and purple cultivars need the sun to develop their colors. When the head gets a diameter of about 2 - 3 inches, tie the outer leaves loosely over the developing head with a soft cloth.\nCauliflower head will be ready for harvest a week or two weeks after blanching.\n\n\n \nGreen peas\n\nGreen peas are popular winter-season vegetables, which are part of the legume family Fabaceae. The peas are most commonly the small spherical seeds of the fruit Pisum sativum. Botanically peas are quick-growing herbaceous vine rich in essential vitamins and antioxidants like Vitamin K, C, and E. Green peas are a good source of plant-based proteins and they also give protection against some chronic illnesses such as heart disease and cancer. Peas will be most productive if they have a supportive structure to climb.\nTips to Grow Green peas\n\nChoose the location that at least gets 6-8 hours of sunlight \nPeas prefer well-drained soil with rich organic matter\nSow the seeds at 1-inch depth and 1 - 2 inches apart\nThey need a good amount of water especially at the pod formation stage\nHarvest the peas when pods of them appear to be swelling with rounded pea forms visible.\n\n \nRadish\n\nRadishes are not only the popular vegetables but they are the healthiest vegetables also. Raphanus sativus is a group of root vegetables grown for their crunchy roots of peppery taste. They can be eaten fresh or cooked too. The leaves of radishes have been used to treat jaundice, sore throat, and blood sugar issues. These root vegetables contain a good amount of vitamins, minerals, and nutritional compounds that can positively affect your health.\nTips to Grow Radish\n\nChoose the spot where they can get an adequate amount of sunlight \nLoose, permeable, well-drained soil should not be compacted, as planting in compact soil will make it difficult for the downward growth of their roots\nSow the seeds at depth of about ½ inch and 1 - 2 inches apart\nThin the seedlings to 1 - 4 inches apart after reaching 2 - 3 inches height\nSupply radishes with an adequate amount of water so they can grow quickly\nHarvest roots as soon as they have reached approximately 1 inch in diameter across the soil surface.\n\n \nNutrient management in Winter Vegetable garden\n\nHealthy soil is the one that affects the optimum growth of the vegetables in your garden. For the healthy growth of the plants, many essential components are required along with healthy and fertile soil. Even if you are lucky enough to get great gardening soil, as your plants grow, they absorb nutrients and leave the soil less fertile. To fill up lost nutrients again in the soil, you need to provide some extra food to it. \n\nPlants require primary macronutrients and some additional nutrients for their optimum growth. Among them, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium are the three primary macronutrients, and Calcium, Magnesium, Sulfur are the three secondary macronutrients that play a very important role in a plant’s growth. So, you need to choose the fertilizer by keeping all these in consideration. \n\n\n\nWe highly recommend the use of organic fertilizers as they are not only packed with all these essential nutrients but also stimulate beneficial soil microorganisms, improving the texture and structure of the soil. Soil microbes play an important role in converting organic fertilizers into soluble nutrients that can be easily absorbed by plants.\nThe plants need extra food at the time of planting, flowering, and fruiting. It is recommended to apply fertilizers every four to six weeks after planting. When it comes to the best time to apply fertilizer, we can say early morning and late evening to maximize the usage of nutrients.\n\n \nWatering in Vegetable garden\nWatering is one of the important key factors of any successful vegetable garden. Water acts as a carrier for the movement of nutrients from the soil to plants.  But the concept of watering in the vegetable garden has always been tricky.\nEach area requires a different amount of water according to its different climatic conditions. Sunny and dry weather of summer season tends to require more water compared to cold weather in winter season. So, don’t water your plants blindly without thinking. It is always better to check the moisture level of the soil before watering it. When the soil sticks in your hand, it is moist enough, but if it barely sticks to your hand, looks dry and cracky, then go and grab your water can.\n\n\nVegetables in winter season don't need much water as they do in the summer. But they need deep watering few times a month\nIt is always best to water your plants in the early morning or late evening, but try to avoid the middle of the day. \nWatering in the early morning is always best during winter season, as it allows the plants to absorb water properly and foliage to dry quickly, which discourages fungal growth\nIf you don’t have time to water in the early morning, then the late evening will work for you rather than winter. Because moisture won’t evaporate too fast, hence plants will get enough time to absorb water\nWatering at the base of the plants is always best as it delivers the water directly to the roots where it is needed.\nAvoid watering on the leaves as it increases the risk of fungal growth and other leaf diseases.\n\n \nPest management in Winter Vegetable garden\nAll those who love gardening should be ready to face the pests, and that's a part of every gardener’s life. As garden lovers, we should learn some strategies to deal with these uninvited guests. Once you are going to grow vegetables organically, you will need to figure out some organic pest control methods as vegetable plants are more prone to various kinds of pest infestation.\nHere, we have listed the most common and destructive vegetable garden pests.\n \nAphids\n\nAphids are usually small, pear-shaped insects with long sucking types of mouthparts. They suck sap from the leaves and stems causing leaf curling and stunted plant growth. They can also transmit some diseases and sooty mold.\nCommon host plants - Cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, and beans.\n \nLeaf miners\n\nTiny insects whose larvae feed under the surface of leaves leaving a meandering track. Their feeding causes a lot of healthy tissue becomes infected with the disease.\nCommon host plants - Tomatoes, onions, beans, peas, cucumber, and some leafy vegetables.\n \nThrips\n\nAdults are too tiny straw-colored or black slender insects. Thrips usually hide under the leaves or in barks. The infestation results in tiny spots, lesions, and downward leaf curling.\n Common host plants - Onions, tomatoes, beans, capsicums, and cucumbers.  \n \nCutworms \n\nCutworms are moth larvae that hide under the soil during the day, coming out in the dark to feed on plants. As their name suggests, they cut the stems and the leaves of crops and seedlings.\nCommon host plants - Beans, cabbage, carrots, peas, and tomatoes.\n \nWhiteflies\n\nThese are soft-bodied, winged insects. Whiteflies are somewhat triangular in shape and are often found in clusters on the underside of the leaves. They feed on the sap of the leaves, hence leaves will wilt, turn pale or yellow and the growth of the plant will be stunted.  \nCommon host plants - Beans, cabbage, cucumber, and tomatoes.\n \nSlugs and snails\n\nSlugs and snails are among the most destructive pests in vegetable gardens. Typically they are not insects but ground-dwelling mollusks. They feed on the smooth edges of leaves and leave irregular holes behind.\nCommon host plants- Slugs and snails feed on a wide variety of plants including seeds, tubers, leaves, and fruits.\n \n\nThe first step to control pests in your garden is handpicking. Remove the pests by hand, if you see them and immediately dispose them. You can also pluck the pest-infected plant parts like leaves and dispose of them to prevent further spread.\n\n\n\nUsing neem oil is another most effective pest control measure. Neem oil can be used to control many sucking pests such as mealybugs, aphids, thrips mites, and whiteflies. It can be used as a foliar spray and also as a soil drench. While spraying neem oil be sure to cover both sides of the leaves of affected plants. Try to spray neem oil in the early morning or late evening, when the pollinators are not out as much.\n\n\n\nGrowing garlic as a companion crop in your garden can be a great preventive measure to save your vegetables from pests and harmful pesticides. You can also use garlic water as an eco-friendly repellent against borers, weevils, bugs, and fruit flies. The heavy pungent smell of garlic is due to the presence of sulfur compound allicin, this is what makes garlic work so well against pests.\n\n \nThere is nothing like growing and harvesting food from your own vegetable garden. You can enjoy the journey of a small seed that turns into food on your dining table. It can be the best way to teach your children about the importance of nature and food. The organic vegetable garden is a great way to save our mother nature from harmful chemicals and also it helps us to save ourselves from food-borne illness. So, let’s take initiative to be self-reliant and sustainable by growing our own veggies.\n \nFrequently asked questions\n﻿1. What is the purpose of thinning?\nThinning is a practice of removing some extra plants, to provide plants with sufficient space so that they can receive all the requirements for their growth without having to compete with other seedlings.\n \n2. Why is Blanching Necessary for Cauliflower?\nBlanching in cauliflower is done to maintain the white color of the head or curd. This practice stops the enzyme actions, which otherwise cause loss of flavor, color, and texture.\n \n3. What are the causes for Buttoning in Cauliflower?\nButtoning is generally known as the development of small curd. Several factors are responsible for this physiological disorder such as insufficient moisture supply, waterlogging, poor nitrogen supply, hot and dry weather.\n \n4. What are cold-weather crops?\nCold weather crops germinate in cold soil and mature with cool weather and a short period of daylight. These vegetables not only withstand cold temperatures, but also they need them to germinate, grow, set fruit, and mature.\n \n5. Watering in Vegetable garden\nWatering in the vegetable garden is always tricky task. Each climate requires a different amount of water according to the weather. Sunny weather tends to require more water compared to cold weather.

Well-drained soils do not drain too quickly or too slowly, they allow water to drain at a moderate rate. So the plants will get enough time to absorb water.\n \n9. Which vegetable grows faster in winter?\nRadishes are one of the fastest vegetables you can grow in winter. They can be grown all year round. They are ready to harvest after about 4 - 5 weeks of sowing.\n \n10. What are the signs of overwatering?\n\nSoil is wet but the plant looks wilted\nThe leaves turn brown and wilt\nYellow falling leaves\nRoot rot of the plant.\n\n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colorful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot\n ",

        "articleBody": "\nGenerally in our garden, we plant flowers as a hobby, to give it a good look, or just because of that we love them. Some may also think that planting flowers is just a waste of our productive land or space. Besides all these conceptions and misconceptions, there are much deeper reasons why we should maintain flowers in our garden. Surprisingly they can act as pest controllers, weed controllers, fertilizers, ground covers, and this list goes on. Apart from benefiting our garden, they also benefit us in many ways. So let’s have a look in detail.\n1. Flowers attract pollinators:\n\n\nThe process of transfer of pollen grains from anthers of one flower to stigma of another flower of same/different plants (of same kind) is known as pollination. Insects such as butterflies, honey bees, bumblebees, moths, wasps help in pollination which plays a major in the production of fruits and vegetables in plants. These insects are known as pollinators. You might have observed good flowering in your vegetable/fruit plants but got upset with the number of fruits they produce. This mainly happens due to the lack of pollination. A flower turns into fruits only after the pollination took place. So having flowers in your vegetable garden is very important to attract pollinators for better production.\n \n2. Flowers are natural pest controllers:\nFlowers help in pest control indirectly. Nectar, a sugar-rich fluid which is present in plants attracts pollinators, along with some other birds and beneficial insects like lacewings, ladybugs, mantids, hoverflies that feed on insect pests in your garden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages of lady bug, lacewing larva, mantis and hover fly larva feeding on pests\nThese beneficial insects are known as predatory insects. These insects feed on eggs and larvae (caterpillars, maggots, grubs, nymphs) of the pests which results in the natural controlling of pests. In other words, we can say that planting flowers also help in reducing the use of chemical pesticides in our garden.\n\n3. Flowers can control weed growth:\n\nWe spend a lot of time, energy, and money on weeding in our gardens. There are some flowering plants that grow densely at short heights. Their profuse growth completely shades the ground below. When we grow these plants in the empty places of our garden they act as ground covers. As these plants grow very close to each other, weeds cannot grow in between them due to the lack of space and sunlight. Thus we can say goodbye to weeds.\n\nImages of candytufts and creeping phlox acting as ground covers in garden.\n \ncandytufts, creeping phlox, deadnettle, nasturtiums are some of the examples of flowering ground covers. It is also very easy to grow these plants as these are low maintenance plants. Creeping phlox plants spread and cascade very well in slopes and garden walls and make them look beautiful. While the white flowers of candytufts are often so profuse that we can’t even see its leaves below the flowers. Thus constructs the best ground cover in your garden.\n\n4. Flowers acts as nitrogen fertilizer:\nIn our atmosphere there is plenty of nitrogen, nearly 78 % of our air contains only nitrogen. Yet plants cannot use it for their growth or development. This is why we supply nitrogen artificially to plants. But there are some bacteria that can fix this atmospheric nitrogen into soil by having an association with the roots of some plants. We call these plants leguminous plants and these bacteria nitrogen-fixing bacteria. \n\nLupine flowers\nLupine, which is a flowering plant is one among these leguminous plants. Besides producing beautiful flowers, it also acts as free nitrogen fertilizer in your garden. These plants fix the atmospheric nitrogen into the soil by having a symbiotic association with bacteria in their roots. Here both of them are getting benefited. Bacteria help plants in extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere while plants provide shelter and energy to the bacteria. So all together we can say that lupine is an attractive nitrogen fixer, which enriches the soil of your garden.\nOther benefits of lupine plants are:\n\nImproves the soil structure.\nIncreases the organic matter content when buried/incorporated into the soil.\nAttracts pollinators with its beautiful flowers.\nCan tolerate full sun to partial shade conditions.\n\n\n\n5. Flowering plants can act as traps for insects:\n\nSome flower plants also act as trap crops, these plants attract insect pests to feed on them and sacrifice themselves to protect the targeted vegetable crops. For example, marigolds helps in attracting slugs, snails, and nematodes away from the plants like potatoes, tomatoes, beans, and cucumbers. While nasturtiums attract aphids such as black flies, green flies, and whiteflies, which are serious pests of vegetables(mainly cucurbits) and ornamental plants.  \n\nMarigolds are grown on borders as trap crop\nOther benefits of nasturtiums:\n\n\nFlower for longer periods.\nProduce beautiful flowers.\nAvailable in many different shades.\nCan make good ground covers and prevent the growth of weeds.\n\nHave antimicrobial &amp; antibiotic properties.\n\n\nDon’t forget to uproot and destroy these sacrificing plants after harvesting your vegetables. Neglecting may turn these plants into righteous habitats for pests and diseases as they are no longer resistant to their invasions and infestations.\n\n6. Flowers add beauty to your garden:\n\nThere is no better option than adding flowers to make your garden look beautiful. With proper pruning and deadheading, we can make plants produce more flowers. Growing flowers in different fashions like traps, ground covers, hedges, trees can offer more beauty with benefits to your garden.\n\nSo these are all the benefits which flowers do to your garden but do you know that flowers also benefit us in many ways.\n\nBenefits of flowers for mankind:\n\nFlowers can improve our mood\nPlanting flowers/any other plants can give us a good physical activity\nHaving flowers in our garden can save and make money.\nFlowers are used in the composition of many beauty cosmetics:\n\n\n\n\nMany flowers are used in making beauty products as they are having skin nourishing, whitening, refreshing, and repairing properties in them.\nFlowers like rose, lilies, lavender, jasmine, chamomile, are used in making many products like lotions, creams, serums, essential oils, perfumes, and deodorants. So you can grow some of these beneficial flowers to help your skin along with your garden.\n\n     5. Flowers in medicinal uses:\n\nMany flowers have anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic properties which make them fit to use in making medicines (ayurvedic, allopathic, and homeopathic). We can also make use of them right in our home by making teas or kashaya (water extract of flowers). Hibiscus, nasturtiums, rose, calendula are some of the flowers that hold medicinal properties in them.\n\n\n \nSo this is all about the benefits of the flowers. So let’s get into some more useful information about flowers. Like fruits/vegetables, flowers also grow according to the seasons. Some flowers bloom in summers while some in winters. Flowers are classified into summer flowers and winter flowers based on the season they bloom.\n\nSummer flowers: \nIn summers, there is nothing so relaxing than spending time in your garden that is having astonishing flowers in it. So let’s take a look at flowers that we can grow to get colorful blossoms in baking hot summers.\nMarigolds, lilies, roses, zinnias, daisies, morning glory, phlox, hibiscus, cosmos, gomphrena are some of the summer flowering plants that you can sow between march to april. Some of these flowers tend to flower immediately after 2-3 months of sowing while you have to wait for a few more days/months to enjoy the beauty of other flowers. Besides producing fascinating flowers, they also provide various amazing benefits to us and to our garden as well. So let’s take a short look into them.\nBenefits of marigolds:\n\nAct as a trap crops.\nEasy to care for and maintain.\nRoots of marigolds produce chemicals that are effective in killing nematodes in the garden.\nAttracts pollinators and predatory insects.\nIts oil helps in treating sunburns, acne, insect bites, etc.\n\nYou can intercrop vegetables with marigolds to keep the pest populations in control.\n\n\nBenefits of roses:\n\n\nFlowers are also edible.\nWidely used in beauty products.\nActs as an air freshener in gardens.\nRosewater/ rose oil contains a good number of antioxidants.\n\nAlso contains anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n\nBenefits of lillies:\n\nLilies are perennials, that return year after year.\nEasy to divide and transplant.\nRoots and bulbs of lilies are known to use for medicinal purposes.\n\n\nBenefits of hibiscus: hibiscus, native to warm climates is packed with a lot of shocking health benefits.\n\n\nThe anthocyanin pigment which is responsible for the red color of the petals has numerous health benefits.\nPetals of hibiscus contains a huge number of anti-oxidants that can be used in making tea. This tea helps in treating high blood pleasures.\nHelps in lowering blood cholesterol levels.\nLeaves and flowers of hibiscus are also used in treating problems of skin and hair.\n\n\nWinter-flowers: \nThere are many flowers that particularly bloom in winters. Out of those cineraria, clarkia, calceolaria, petunia, impatiens, sweet williams, alyssum, hollyhock, salvia, and pansies are some of the highly recommended winter flowers as these flowers are absolutely beautiful and can give a vibrant and radiant look to your garden. \n\nAll these are seasonal plants, that are annuals/biennials. For long-lasting flowerings or all-time good-looking gardens, you can go for embracing perennial flowers in your gardens. It is nothing surprising that few flowers (shrubs/trees) also live for many years. As these plants live for three/more years we call them perennial plants. These plants either flower in a particular season every year or some may bloom continuously irrespective of the season. \n\n\nPerennial flowers:\nVerbena, vinca species, ixora, pinwheel, tecoma, oleander, and plumeria are some of the plants by growing which, you can have colorful flowers throughout the year. We can also grow these plants in different fashions. For example, pinwheel, ixora and vinca can be grown as hedges. Believe it or not, these plants can give a perfect outline than any other metal/wooden fencing. \n\nBenefits of growing flowers as hedges:\n\nIxora plants as hedge.\n\nThey protect the plants from strong winds and can also act as windbreaks.\nProtect plants from animal grazing when grown in borders.\nCan train these plants to give particular shape for added descent look in your garden.\nThese can make flawless partitions in your garden.\nAttract pollinators.\nHedges play important role in landscaping as well.\n\nFlowering plants as trees:\nFlowers like oleander, tecoma, and plumeria can be grown as trees. As the trees grow heights they can attract more pollinators with both their fragrance and colorful flowers. \n\nPlumeria and Oleander trees in gardens.\n\nAdditional benefits of having flowering trees:\n\nThese flowers are definitely attention-stealing that we can’t take off our eyes from them easily.\nProvide shade to sit and enjoy under them even in summers.\nAttract birds that aid in pollination and pest controlling in our garden.\n\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n1. What is pollination?The process of transfer of pollen grains from the stamen (male reproductive part) to the stigma of the pistil (female reproductive part) is known as pollination.\n\n2. Who are pollinators?\nAny organism that helps in transferring the pollen grains from anthers to stigma is known as a pollinator. Examples: insects (bees, moths, butterflies), birds, animals (like rats, monkeys, through contact), humans too(through contact).\n\n3. What is a pest?Any organism that causes harm/damage to plants is considered a pest. Examples: insects, birds, animals, even humans. Humans are also considered pests while causing damage to plants.\n\n\n\n4. What are ground covers?Any material when used on top of soil to protect it from erosions, water loss, weed growth is known as ground covers. Examples: plastic mulching, closely growing low height plants, wood chips, dry leaves, peanut shells, etc.\n\n\n\n5. What are the low-maintenance ground covers?Creeping phlox, candytufts, dead nettle, trailing periwinkle, moss phlox, creeping jenny, vinca minor are some of the low maintenance ground covers for your garden to keep weeds at bay.  \n\n\n\n6. What is symbiotic association?It is a special type of interaction between two organisms, some times both are benefited(mutualism), some times one is benefited while the other is neither benefited nor harmed (commensalism), and some times one (parasite) is benefited while the other (host) is harmed (parasitism)\n\n\n\n7. What are nematodes?The microscopic organisms(eelworms) present in the soil that belong to the phylum nematoda are known as nematodes. These worms damage the plant roots, while few nematodes also act as vectors in transferring viruses from plant to plant. Mixing neem powder in the potting mix helps in controlling nematodes. \n\n\n\n8. Do nasturtiums come back every year?It is saddening that these beautiful multi-beneficial nasturtiums are annuals. But they can be easily propagated and grown through their cuttings.\n\n\n\n9. Do nasturtiums climb?Yes. Nasturtiums do climb when given support. They cascade very well on the ground too, this is why we grow them as ground covers.\n\n\n\n10. What is a hedge?A fence or boundary formed by growing plants close to each other is known as hedges. It provides privacy when grown as walls (outer boundary to a garden). It acts like a frame to a picture.\n\n\n\n11. Does marigold come back every year?Even though the marigolds are annuals they come back every year due to self-seeding.\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Does hibiscus like sun or shade?Hibiscus plants grow well in full sun. Most of the hibiscus species like warm climates. It can also tolerate partial shade.\n\n\n\n13. How to grow tropical and perennial hibiscus?Tropical hibiscus grows well in moist but well-drained soil while perennial hibiscus grows well in moist soil that never completely dries out.\n\n\n\n14. Do sweet williams come back every year?Most of the sweet williams are biennials, they live for two years. While species of them are also perennials.15. Do petunias need sun or shade?Petunias are grown as annuals, even though they are perennials in real. Petunia can tolerate the full sun. Their blooming decreases when placed in the shade.\n\n\n16. What is the difference between annuals, biennials, and perennials?Annuals complete their life cycle in one growing season or one year, biennials complete their life cycle in two seasons or two years while the plants that live for three or more years are known are perennials.17. What is deadheading a plant?Removing dry/faded flowers to direct the energy from spent flowers to good ones is known as deadheading. This helps in producing more flowers.\n\n\n\n\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot\n",

        "articleBody": "Micro-irrigation is a modern method of irrigation that delivers water slowly and helps in conserving water when compared to traditional methods of watering. Micro Irrigation system helps in supplying water with low flow and pressure on surface and subsurface in many ways such as drippers, sprinklers, foggers, and bubblers. Some of the micro-irrigation methods are\n\nSprinkler irrigation\nDrip irrigation\nSubsurface irrigation\nBubbler irrigation\n\n\nAmong all of these, drip irrigation is the popular micro-irrigation method and is also used in gardens by few urban gardeners. \n\nDrip irrigation: \nDrip irrigation is also known as trickle irrigation or drop-by-drop irrigation method. Unlike other irrigation methods, those which saturates/drench the soil more than required level, drip irrigation supplies water only up to the required depth that is up to the root zone. \n\nDrip irrigation in agriculture:\nAll thanks to the drip system, which facilitates the slow supply of water in drops to provide the right amount of water to plants. Unlike other irrigation methods, it successfully irrigates the plants that are cultivated in uneven/sloped lands. \n\nimage sourceThe drip system also facilitates fertilizing plants where fertilizers are diluted and supplied through the pipes/tubes. Let’s get into the details of the components of the system.\nLayout/components of the drip irrigation system:\nThe drip irrigation system has many components to facilitate the proper delivery of water to plants. They are.\n1. Pump station\n2. Control head\n3. Mainlines\n4. Sublines\n5. Laterals\n6. Emitters \n \nPump unit/pump station: It takes water from the water source and delivers them to the pipe system with the right pressure.\nControl head: It contains valves that help in controlling the discharge and pressure in the entire system. It has a filter system and may have a fertilizer tank too.\nFilter system: The system contains filters to filter the unwanted materials in the water. Screen filters and graded sand filters are the most common filters that are used in drip systems and help in removing the fine materials suspended in the water.\n Fertilizer/nutrient tank: This tank is also known as venturi.  It contains a measured dose of fertilizer and the system adds it in water during the irrigation.\n\nMainlines, sub mains, and laterals: They are usually made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or polyethylene hose. They can be laid outside or buried below ground. It is recommended to be buried as they easily degrade/damage when exposed to direct solar radiation. The average diameters of these Laterals pipes are 12 mm - 16 mm.\nEmitters: Emitters or drippers are installed on lateral lines and they control the speed of discharge of water. The spacing of the emitter can be varied according to the requirement i.e. they can be spaced far from each other in orchards while can be spaced closed to each other to irrigate plants in rows. An ideal emitter has to provide constant discharge without stoppage/blockage even when there is a slight alterations in pressure.\n\nThe drip system is even introduced into centrally sponsored schemes by recognizing its efficiency in water-conserving and energy-saving. It is widely encouraged by the central government by creating awareness and providing financial assistance to introduce and encourage the drip system in many parts of the country.   \n\nIn agriculture, it is mostly used with plastic mulches for increased water use efficiency. It creates protection from sun and rain and also turns down the weed growth to a large extent. \n\nBenefits of using drip irrigation system with plastic mulches: \n\nimage source\n\nIt regulates soil moisture.\nDecreases soil-borne and plant diseases.\nReduces soil leaching and soil erosion.\nIncreases the rate of growth and quality of the produce.\n\n\n Advantages of drip irrigation in agriculture: \n\n\nDrip irrigation helps in water conservation as the water use efficiency of the drip system is as high as 70 - 90 % which is greater than any other irrigating method.\n\nIt reduces the runoff, by which a huge amount of water loss occurs in other types of irrigation. \nIt reduces evaporation losses.\nIt also helps in fertilizing and irrigating the plants at the same time. The process of fertilization + irrigation is known as fertigation.\n\nimage source\n\nDrip irrigation helps in the uniform application of the right amount of water and nutrients to plants.\nIt perfectly irrigates slopped and undulated surfaces.\nDecreases the labor cost as it reduces weed growth.\n\nDrip irrigation also saves energy as it runs with low pressure.\n\n\n\nDrip irrigation in gardening:\n\nDrip system has also been dragged to urban gardening which is used by many passionate gardeners and plant lovers. Unlike drip system in agriculture, which is designed for largescale, the design of garden drip system is different. When compared, a garden drip system is simple, more convenient and easy to install and use. \n \nTypes of drip irrigation systems:\nGardening drip irrigation systems are of two types1. Manual drip irrigation system2. Automated drip irrigation system.\n\n 1. Manual drip irrigation system:\n\nLayout or components of manual drip irrigation system:It has the following components\n1. Supply line pipe\n2. Feeder line pipe\n3. Tap adaptor\n4. Drip hole puncher\n5. Pin connectors\n6. Elbow connectors\n7. Tee connectors\n8. Straight connectors\n9. Straight connectors with tap\n10. Dummy\n11. Stakes and\n12. Emitters. \n \nHow to install the manual drip irrigation system: \nChoose a drip system according to your need so that it can serve all of your plants whether they are planted in pots or in the garden. \n\n\nMake holes on the supply line using the drip hole punch at the required places.\nCut the feeder pipe into many parts as per requirement and connect one end of the feeder pipe to the supply line using pin connectors.\n\nInsert stake and dripper at the other end of the feeder pipe and fix the emitter near to the base of plants with the help of stakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, fix the feeder pipes at every required point or pots to supply water to all plants.\nDirect the pipe to different locations or different areas using connectors such as elbow connectors, tee connectors, straight connectors.\n\nElbow connectors are used to guide irrigation pipes (main line) at corners.\n\n \n\nTee connectors are used to distribute the supply line in two opposite directions.\n\nStraight connectors are used to reconnect two ends of the irrigation pipes.\n\n\n\nStraight connectors with tap are used to regulate the flow of water so that they help in watering plants that have different water requirements.\n\n\n\n\nBlock the wrongly punched/unwanted holes using dummy pins.\nBlock the end of the supply line/pipe using an end cap.\nConnect the supply line to the tap using a tap adaptor. Turn on the tap in low flow mode to ensure better water usage.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow to use a manual drip irrigation system:\nOnce the setup of the drip irrigation system is completed, it is very easy to use the system. Attach the supply line to tap using the tap adapter and turn on the tap in low flow mode. Regulate the water flow at desired locations to meet the water requirements of different plants. You can also regulate the speed of dripping of water by loosening or tightening the emitter (can be rotated). Once the plants are watered enough, turn off the tap. \n\nAdvantages of using manually operated drip irrigation system:\n\nAll the plants can be watered at once.\nSaves time.\nNo energy consumption.\nThe rate of flow of water for different plants can be regulated according to the plants’ needs.\nPrevents overwatering and leaching.\nCost-effective as it is a one-time investment.\nLasts for a long time.\n\n\nDisadvantages of manually operated drip irrigation system:\n\nLittle expensive when compared to regular watering methods (hose pipe/water cans).\nPlants should be placed close to each other according to the length of the supply line or can be extended further by adding another kit according to the need.\n\n\n\n2. Automated drip irrigation system:\nThe layout, installation, and usage of an automated drip irrigation system is also the same as of manual drip irrigation system but the automated system comes with an electronic water timer. Which needs to be fixed between the water source and main pipeline to regulate the time and duration and of watering. \nimage source, image source\n\nAdvantages of automated drip irrigation system over the regular one: \n\nIt also provides all the benefits of the regular drip irrigation system.\nAs it is an automated system, we can set the time i.e. at what time it can water the plants.\nWe can also set the timing for how long we want our plants to be watered.\nIt can also set the regular intervals of time i.e. for every 24 hours, 12 hours, etc.\nThe main advantage of this automated drip irrigation system is that we can water our plants even when we are on vacation as it takes care of our plants regularly.\nCost-effective as it is also a one-time investment.\n\n\nDisadvantages of automated drip irrigation system:\n\nExpensive than a regular drip irrigation system.\nPlants should be placed close to each other according to the length of the supply line or can be extended further by adding another kit according to the need.\n\n\nFrequently asked questions: \n\n\n How many emitters are needed for a tree?Generally, five to six emitters/drippers are sufficient to irrigate a tree. while it also depends on tree's size, water requirement and rate of flow of water.When it comes to gardening, one dripper can serve one or two plants in regular gardening (when grown in rows) and one plant in container gardening. \n\n\n \n\n\n Is drip irrigation bad?Drip irrigation is never bad whether it may be in agriculture or gardening. It benefits both the farmers and gardeners with its high water-conserving and low energy-consuming abilities. It reduces production and labor costs by increasing the yields/produce and decreasing weeds simultaneously. \n\n\n \n\n What are the types of drip irrigation?\n\nDrip irrigation is of two types1. Surface drip irrigation: Mostly used in gardening, orchards.2. Subsurface irrigation: Used in intensive agriculture.\n\n\n\n Can we use drip irrigation in gardening?Yes, you can use drip irrigation in gardening. long with conserving water, it also conserves your time and energy. By adjusting the speed of dripping of water, you can successfully water different water requirement plants at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is it expensive to install drip irrigation? Yes, it is a little expensive to install a drip system but it completely worth your money. It consumes less energy and saves a lot of water. It nearly saves/conserves 70% of water when compared to traditional watering methods (flooding, furrow, level basin irrigations) by which you can irrigate the plants for many days with the same energy and water when compared.\n\n\n \n\n How to water plants on vacation?\n\nUsing an automated drip irrigation system is the best option to go for when you plan to go on vacations. Because other methods may end up overwatering your plants. \n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot",

        "articleBody": "Who doesn't like to have a beautiful garden at their home? Everyone does. A Healthy and beautiful garden demands quality input and a bit of hard work. That means when you have all the necessary conditions like the place, soil, water source, and plan to start a garden, the very next and most important thing for gardening is planting material. \nPlanting material refers to seeds, seedlings, corms, or stem cuttings. If you fail to select the good planting material or plants for your garden, you cannot expect a better outcome from those planting materials. That's why it's very important for you to select the best planting material or seeds for your garden. \n\n \n\nDifferent planting materials: \n\nSeeds\nSeedlings\nStem cuttings\nCorms\nBulbs\nSuckers\n\n\n You have many choices for starting a garden. You can start with any planting materials like seeds, seedlings, plants, or bulbs &amp; corms. You can select any one among these and go for planting. But always check twice whether the selected planting material is of good quality. Here are a few points you need to keep in your mind about selecting the best planting material for your garden. \nThe selection of the best seeds:  \nSeeds that you select for your garden should be always\n\nFree from weed seeds and free of viral borne diseases. That's why it is always recommended to buy seeds from authenticated companies or sellers\nWhatever seeds you select, should grow in your region or climatic conditions where you live.\nAnd you have to consider the germination percentage also. You can go for selecting seeds with a germination percentage of more than 90%. \n\n\n\n\nSelection of best seedlings: \n\n\nConsider the origin of seedlings i.e. from where they have grown: If the seedlings are from Himachal Pradesh and you are living in Rajasthan. you can't purchase them to grow successfully. Because those seedlings were adapted to the low-temperature region so they can't grow well in the high-temperature region. That's why once check with the shop keeper, from where did they bring the seedlings. \n\n\n\n\n\nConsider morphological and physiological quality: The seedling should be good at the morphological quality (appearance) and physiological quality (ability to adapt well to your climate &amp; grow). Seedlings should not be broken, leaves should be green &amp; healthy, and should have the healthy root growth. It should not be physically damaged. This means no damage to any part of the plant. So observe these features before buying the seedlings. \n\n\n\n\nRobust shoot and root growth: next feature to consider is the well-developed leaves, twigs, and roots. Do not select the slow-growing plants, with small leaves. \n\n\nDo remember to check all these features before buying a seedling. Select the best plants for your garden and enjoy the gardening. \n\nSelection of best bulbs and corms:\nBulbs and corms are mainly used for the propagation of flowering plants, tuberous crops, and bulbous crops. To get more flowers,\n\nSelect the healthy and mature bulbs/ corms.   \nPay attention to size (Select bigger size corms): for getting healthy plant growth, you have to select the bigger sized bulbs and corms.\n\n\n \n\n\nSlightly squeeze the bulbs &amp; corms. If they are soft, do not select those bulbs &amp; corms. \nThe next point to consider is, always avoid bruised bulbs.\n\nJust check these simple points, when you want to buy the bulbs &amp; corms.\n\nSelection of best suckers: \nFor some of the plants, you have to use suckers for multiplying them. For example bananas, lilac, red raspberries are propagated or planted through suckers. It is worth discussing how to buy a robust and healthy sucker of your favorite plant. While buying banana suckers consider the shape of their leaves. Do not select broad leaved sucker plants. Suckers with sword shaped leaves should be selected. \n\n( Image source ) \n\nDo not buy small suckers.\nDo not buy suckers that may contain insects like weevils and nematodes\nIf you buying banana suckers check the pseudostem. The stem of the banana is called the pseudostem. If that stem has some dark discolorations do not buy those plants. Because it may be due to some pests and diseases. If you buy such plants and bring home it may spread the disease to the other plants. \nSelect the suckers that have sword shaped leaves instead of broad leaved ones as broad leaved plants may not perform well and result in less yields..\n\nFAQs Related to Selecting Best Planting Material\n\n1. How important is the selection of planting materials in the success of the crop/plant\n\nSuccess of the crop always depends on type of planting materials and climatic conditions. how favorable the climate might be, if you start with the poor planting materials, the result will be always disappointing. So select/purchase planting materials from recognized or trusted sources.\n\n2. What if my seedlings show up leggy?\nLeggy seedlings can still grow better if the germination percentage of seeds/planting materials is about 85 % and are of good quality. They should be transplanted and provided with better resources like quality potting mix and suitable light conditions to grow healthier.\n\n3. What are bulbs and corms?\nBulbs, corms, tubers and rhizomes are underground stem modifications but not roots from which a plant reproduces vegetatively. All these can be used as planting materials to start a new plant.\n 4. When should I separate a sucker from the banana plant?\n\nA sucker should be separated only when it is grown up to 0.3 m. So that it has its own roots to uptake nutrients from soil when it is separated and grown away from the mother plant.\n\n5. When do we consider the seeds are of good quality?\n\nSeeds should be free of weed/other plant seeds.\nSeeds should be free of soil or seed borne diseases.\nSeeds should be free from insect or any other damage.\nGermination percentage should be 90%.\nShould be tolerant to temporary climatic variations.\n\nIf the seeds possess all these qualities, they can be considered as good quality seeds.\n\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot\n\n\n",

There are many natural, chemical-free fertilizers that you can use in your garden to enrich your soil.\nHere are six natural homemade fertilizers that can be prepared by yourself at your home. And can utilize them to fertilize your plants.\n\n Image source\n1. Coffee grounds\n\nUsed coffee grounds can be used for fertilizing your plants. Because it will be rich in all essential elements needed for plants. Once coffee grounds are used they become neutral of pH 6.5, so without any doubt, you can use it to enrich soil fertility of your garden.\n\n\nImage source\n\n\nNutrient status: Coffee grounds are rich in N, Ca, K, Fe, P, Mg\nCoffee grounds absorb heavy metals present in the soil.\nAttract worms to the soil, and improve soil structure.\n\nBeneficial plants: Used coffee grounds can be applied to all kinds of plants.\n\nHow to use: After use of coffee grounds, rinse it with water to remove sugar content, if it contains sugar. Then simply sprinkle over the soil.\n\n\n2. Banana peels: \nAfter enjoying fresh banana fruits, you can use peels to your plants. Even plants enjoy the nutrients present in banana peels.\n\n\n\nNutrient status: Rich in potassium i.e. it contains 42% of potassium. 3.25% of phosphorus, and Magnesium. All these are very essential to your plant's growth.\nBanana peels break down easily and release nutrients for your plants when compared to other organic wastes.\n\nBeneficial plants: Banana peel fertilizer can be applied to all kinds of plants.\n\nHow to use: Dry banana peels under full sun, until they lose moisture completely. After that, you can make a fine powder and use it for your plants. you can also store it for future use as it won't lose its nutritional quality.\nAdd one to one-half spoon of this peel powder to your plants directly.\n\n3. Vegetable &amp; fruit wastes:\nPeels of all vegetables &amp; fruits can be used as fertilizer for your plants.\n\n\nImage source\n\n\nNutrient status: It will contain all kinds of nutrients, as we use different types of vegetables in our kitchen. Moreover, peels of vegetables contain micro-nutrients.\n\nBeneficial plants: Can be applied to all groups of plants.\n\nHow to use: Grind all vegetable waste into a fine paste. Mix this paste in water in the ratio of 1:10. Keep this solution to ferment for 10-15 days. After that, you can spray this solution to plants' foliage. It can be applied to soil as this fermented solution of vegetable waste provides all micro and macro-nutrients to your plants.\n\n\n4. Eggshells \nEggshells are a great source of nutrients for plants and it is also very easy to convert these eggshells into a fertilizer.                                         \n\n\n\n\nNutrient status: Eggshells are rich in Ca, as shells are made of calcium carbonate(CaCO3) i.e. CaO+CO2 = CaCO3. Lime (CaO) is nothing but calcium oxide which is used to treat acidic soil.\nEgg shells when applied to acidic soils, increase the pH level of the soil, and makes it neutral and congenial for all plants to grow well. In Neutral soils, most of the nutrients will be in available form for plants.\n\nBeneficial plants: Good for flowering plants. Can be applied to acidic soils to make it neutral.\n\nHow to use: Just grind the shells into a fine powder, or crush shells into fine pieces. Apply 1-2 tablespoon of this powder directly into the soil of your plants . \n\n5. Rice water\nAfter boiling rice, do not waste rice water, because it is rich in many plant nutrients.\n\n\nImage source\n\n\nNutrient status: Rice water contains N, P, K, and some micro-nutrients.\n\nBeneficial plants: All group of plants\n\nHow to use: After boiling rice in water, separate rice, and water. Keep rice water to cool for some time. After that mix this rice water in normal water in the ratio of 1:15. Apply this solution to your plants directly into the soil and to foliage( leaves) also. Or you can keep this solution for 10 days to ferment well. Later you can use this solution for plants.\nYou can also use this solution as foliar spray to deter insect pests.\nDo not apply hot rice water on plants as it may kill your plants.\nDo not forget to dilute this rice water before use, otherwise it may encourage fungal growth on plants.\n\n6. Tea grounds\nTea grounds contain tannic acid, which creates a good environment for the garden and improves soil structure.\n\n\nImage source\n\n\nNutrient status: Tea grounds contain a good amount of NPK and some trace minerals too.\n\nBeneficial plants: Rose bushes, tomatoes, rhododendron, ferns, blueberries.\nThe application of tea grounds into the soil reduces the alkalinity of the soil and makes it acidic. Therefore apply this home made fertilizer to plants that need acidic soil for their growth and development.\n\nHow to use: After preparation of tea, strain out tea grounds and rinse it in a good amount of water to remove all the sugar content in the tea grounds because sugar content in used tea grounds may attract ants.\n\nMost of the organic wastes can be used as a chemical-free fertilizers for your plants. But be aware of the properties and nutrient level of organic waste. Because the application of wrong home fertilizers may bring bad effects on your plants.\nYou can also opt for indoor anaerobic composting (bokashi method) using air tight bins to make a nutrient rich compost out of kitchen scraps within just 40 days. Try using TrustBin to prepare your own compost for your plants \nFAQs Related to Homemade Fertilizers for Your Plants\n1. Are banana peels good for plants?\nYes. Banana peels are rich source of potassium which is a primary nutrient for plants to complete its lifecycle. It is always better to use the dry banana peels to avoid fungal attack. Dry the peels under sun, grind them into powder and then use it for your plants.\n2. What are the best homemade fertilizers?\n1. Tea grounds2. Coffee grounds3. Banana peels4. Kitchen waste5. Eggshells6. Rice water7. Orange peel powder are some of the best home-made fertilizers for plants.\n3.  Are tea grounds good for roses?\nYes. Roses need slightly acidic (pH 6-6.5) soil for their growth and development. As tea grounds contain \"tannins\" which are acidic, it is ideal to use tea grounds for rose bushes.\n4. What is the best home-made fertilizer for tomatoes?\nCompost made of vegetable waste is the best fertilizer for tomatoes and most of the other vegetables in your garden. You can also prepare your own compost by making vegetable waste into something useful. This can be done anaerobically using indoor composter by Bokashi method.\n5. How often should we use home-made fertilizers?\nPlants cannot perform good by offering more and more fertilizers, no matter how good the fertilizers are. Plants perform well only when they get right amount of nutrition at right time. It is always good to provide fertilizers in their growing seasons with an interval of 3- 4 weeks.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot                  ",

        "articleBody": "\n                           Who does not like lush green healthy plants? Everyone of us loves to keep such healthy plants in our home. But there is one common problem every one of us hate is the yellowing of plants. When you see the leaves of your favorite plant turning yellow, you feel sad and disappointed. But do not lose motivation for growing more plants. Here we will let you know important reasons for the yellowing of your plants and how to save your plants from yellowing.\n\n \nReasons for yellowing of plants: \n1. Overwatering \n2. Underwatering\n3. Nutrient deficiency \n4. Attack of some pest and diseases  \n5. Less sunlight \n     All the reasons listed above are the main reasons for the yellowing of plants. But I will discuss here the yellowing of plants due to less sunlight. We have experimented with two turtle vine plants to show how sunlight has a major role in the growth and development of plants. We kept plant 1 in sunlight and plant 2 in dark for more than a week to check the effect of light on plant's growth.  \nResult of the experiment: \nWe have observed that the plant kept under sunlight was healthy, with lush green leaves. But the plant which was in dark was weak and shown pale yellow color of leaves. So it demonstrates that plants require sunlight to stay green and healthy. \n\n\n\n   \n\nReason for the yellow color of leaves: \nPlants are green in color due to the production of chlorophyll content. In common words, chlorophyll refers to green color pigment present in the plants. That means the green color of plants is mainly due to the presence of chlorophyll pigment. \nPlants need enough amount of sunlight to produce chlorophyll. Hence when plants are unable to produce chlorophyll content their leaves turn into pale green color. So this is the result we got when we kept plant 2 in dark for more than a week. Therefore sunlight takes a major role in maintaining the green color of plants and it is the primary reason for the yellowing of your plants. The factors that effect the growth of plants under the light are as follows, \n\n\nList of light factors that affect the growth of plants: \n1. Intensity of light\n2. Propagation direction of light\n3. Spectrum of light\n \n1. The intensity of light: \nIn common words intensity of the light refers to the brightness of the light or intensity of light refers to amount of energy received per unit area, per unit time.  \n\nIf the place where you live receives intense light or brighter light, then it is very good for the growth of plants. Naturally, every plant loves intense or brighter light except few plants which like to grow in low or indirect light conditions. Examples of such plants are anthurium, peace lily, Boston fern, etc. \nIf sun-loving plants do not receive bright light, they will not bear a good number of flowers and fruits. Therefore the intensity of light is very important for a plant to go through different stages of growth.\n \nHere you can observe the difference between seedlings grown in light and dark. The small seedlings turned pale yellowish color under dark.\nAnd seedlings grown under the light are normally green. When plants produce a good amount of chlorophyll, leaves will be in green color. So for the production of chlorophyll, sunlight is very important. Therefore plants under dark become pale green or yellow color.\nYou might be having a question if the leaves are yellow in color what will be the loss? The answer is, it will not perform the photosynthesis process. If there is no photosynthesis, there is no production of fruits and flowers. That's why sunlight is important for any plant.\n2. Direction of propagation of light: \nPropagation of light refers to the direction of the fall of light i.e. in which direction light travels and in which direction we place our plants. The direction of placing the pot becomes very important, to receive the maximum amount of light. Here is a simple rule to utilize the maximum amount of light, and help your plant to grow well.\nDo not place the plants in an east-west direction. Because they tend to shade each other. When one plant's shade falls on another plant, it reduces the food production in that plant. To overcome this situation you need to place the pots or plants in the North-South direction.\n\n \n\n \nIn the direction of North-South, plants will not shade each other and plants will absorb the maximum amount of light and perform higher photosynthesis. One more advantage of placing plants in the north-south direction is the equal distribution of light. This means all the plants get an equal amount of sunlight.\n3. The spectrum of light:\nSpectrum refers to different wavelengths of energy produced by sunlight. In this spectrum, plants use only 400-700 nm of energy for their photosynthesis. This wavelength of light is called PAR i.e. Photosynthetically Active Radiation. Human beings and plants both can use only this part of the spectrum. 400-700 nm is also called white light (visible light). \n\nRole of different colors of light on the plant:\nWhite light consists of different colors of lights i.e. VIBGOYR. Individual lights have a specific role in the growth of plants. Cumulatively all the colors help the plant to grow well. \nRole of red light: \n\nWavelength- 640-680 nm\nBenefits- plants switch into the reproductive stage.\n\n\n  \n  \nRole of blue light: \n\nWavelength- 450-520 nm\nBenefits- synthesis of chlorophyll.\n\n \n\nLight has a very important role in the growth and development of plants. If plants get insufficient light they start turning into yellow color. So you have to identify this stress before treating them with some chemicals.\n \n\n\n \nSix tips to avoid yellowing of plants: \n\nKeep your sun-loving plants under sunlight for at least 6 hours. Examples of sun-loving plants are rose, hibiscus, bougainvillea, etc. \nDo not treat your plants with chemicals when they show yellowing of leaves. Because it creates stress in them and creates more problems rather than helping them. \nAnalyze the problem first, for what reason they are turning into yellow. As we discussed earlier it may be due to many reasons. so analyzing the problem is more important than treating them. \nDo not keep shade-loving plants under direct sunlight if they are turning yellow. Because when you keep such shade-loving plants under direct sunlight, it causes sun scorching in them. If such plants are showing yellowing of leaves, there may be some other reasons. \nIdentify that reason and follow adequate measures to avoid yellowing in plants. \nShade-loving plants may show yellowing of plant due to overwatering or dehydration. Check whether you overwatered or underwatered the plant. so that you can follow the control measures accordingly. \n\n \nTop questions about light requirement of plants: \n\n1. How much light required for flowering plants? \nUsually, the light requirement for flowering plants is more compared to other foliage plants. Approximately flowering plants require 6 to 8 hours of sunlight. \n2. Can we germinate seeds under darkness?\nSeeds require dark and moist condition for their germination. When you sow seeds, you naturally cover them with soil. So it creates the required darkness for seeds to germinate well. Therefore it is not required to sow seeds in dark conditions or without providing light. Once they germinate, leaves require light for the photosynthesis process. Sowing seeds in dark and exposing seedlings to direct sunlight is a risky process. So you can sow seeds directly under sunlight.\n3. What kind of light is best for growing delicate seedlings? \nIf you have sown your seeds under dark and decided to shift them under light, then place them in indirect light first (instead of direct sunlight) as it is the best light for young seedlings. If you have sown seeds directly under sunlight, seedlings will thrive even in direct sunlight.\n4. Is it okay to keep Anthurium or indoor plants under the sun?\nAnthurium or indoor plants require low light or indirect light for their healthy growth. If you expose those plants to direct sun it causes leaf scorching or sun scorching. It is better to keep them under bright indirect light. It helps them for better flowering if it is a flowering plant. \n 5. Is it possible to grow rose plants in indoor light? \nPlants that require fewer hours of sunlight can be easily grown in indoor light. It is a bit difficult to grow sun loving plants like a rose in indoor light. It needs a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight for its growth and flower production. \n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot ",

        "articleBody": "\n                                   Plants are the most beautiful creatures on this earth. They are also living things like you and me. We want energy to live a enthusiastic and healthy life. So it is same for plants too. They also need the energy to live a healthy life. They obtain this energy through sunlight, water, and soil. Every living organism on this earth needs water to survive and thrive well.\n\n \nAll the metabolic processes/ biological activities that take place inside the plant are directly dependent on water. Every cell of the plant wants water for its survival. Without water, the plant cannot perform photosynthesis ( process of food production), respiration, translocation of food to different parts of the plant. And more importantly, if there is no water in the soil, plants cannot absorb the nutrients. It becomes difficult for a plant to survive. So now lets discuss the role of water in detail.\n \nImportant roles of water in plant's life: \n1. Cell ingredient (90%)\n2. Nutrient availability\n3. Translocation of the food\n4. Transpiration\n5. Microbial growth\n6. Mechanical support and rigid shape\n7. May die without water\n \n 1. Nutrient availability:\nPlants need food and water for their survival; they get it from the soil. When the soil of your plant contains a good amount of water, nutrients can be absorbed by the plant roots because water solubilizes all the nutrients in the soil and makes it available to the plant roots. So in the absence of water your potting media lies dry and make plants unable to intake nutrients so plants wilt and eventually die to the lack of water. so do water plants regularly.\n\n  \n2. Cell ingredient (90%):\nA plant cell is made up of 90% water. 90% of the plant's body consists of water. So by this water percentage, you can understand the role of water in a plant. Water is very essential to plants for their survival.\n\n \n 3.Translocation of the food:\nIt means whatever the food prepared in the leaves has to be transported to different parts of the plant like stems, roots, flowers, and fruits. So water acts as a carrier for this process of transportation of food materials.\n\n \n4.Transpiration:\nTranspiration refers to the loss of water from plants through the leaf surface. Or it can be called plant sweating. When there is no water supply to the soil, whatever water present in the plant may evaporate and lose the complete water. Therefore the regular application of water is important for the plants. \n\n\n5. Microbial growth:\nFor the healthy growth and development of microbes in the soil, water is very important. You might be having a question that what is the use of microbes in the soil? Microorganisms play a crucial role in plant nutrients availability. They convert some unavailable form of nutrients into available form to help your plants. Therefore to maintain a good population of microorganisms, maintain the optimum amount of water in your soil.\n\n\n6. Mechanical support and rigid shape:\nThe presence of water in a plant body gives it a shape and mechanical support. Loss of water from the plant body makes it wilt. and the plant will not have the mechanical support to stand straight.   \n \n7. May die without water:\nIf your plant do not get the water for straight one week, it may die. Your plant can survive without fertilizers, without light for some period of time but it cannot survive without water for a long time.\n \nclick here to know how to water your indoor and outdoor plants in detail\n \nHarmful effects of water stress on plants: \n1. Wilting \n2. Reduced photosynthesis \n \n1. Wilting:\nThe first visual sign of water stress may be wilting. The plant will lose its shape and starts drooping. By this, you should understand that your plants need water. If you notice such signs water your plants immediately.\n\n\n2. Reduced photosynthesis:\nIt means plants will not bear a good number of flowers and fruits. Because water acts as the main ingredient in the process of food production. You cannot easily identify the reduced production of food in a plant.\nSo easy way to identify the water stress is wilting It is the first symptom of water stress in a plant. If a plant is wilted and still green, it can be recovered if noticed and watered early. But a plant that is wilted and turned brown cannot be recovered easily. So do notice the plants keenly and provide water according to its need before it is getting wilted . Just keep in contact with the plants, they will actually tell you what they want (by expressions like, wilting, drooping, yellowing).\n \n\nAdvantages of drip irrigation in watering plants: \nThe application of water to plants drop by drop for efficient use of water is known as drip irrigation (drip irrigation kit).\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nYou can save 80% of water if you opt for drip irrigation for your plants when compared to other methods of water application. \nPlants absorb water more efficiently, as we provide water at the root zone of the plants. \nEqual distribution of water for every plant. \nUnlike other watering methods, loss of nutrients present in the soil through leaching will be very less. So plants will get maximum nutrients without suffering from the loss of nutrients. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nfrequently asked questions:\n1. What is the best time to water your plants? \n    Research has shown that watering early in the morning and evening gives more time for plants to absorb water well when compared to watering in other times. \n2. Which is the best way to water your plants? \n\nWater your plants at the root zone, because plants absorb water only at the root zone, applying water on the foliage brings many problems to plants.\nUse the right watering container for different types of plants. For example, for seedlings, you have to sprinkle water, for matured plants use a big-sized watering can for water application. \nWater at the right time i.e. morning or evening\nWater them deeply and thoroughly and wait until the top inch layer of soil becomes dry before watering them again.\n\n3. How to water plants outdoor?\nPlants that are located outdoors usually require more water compare to indoor plants. This is mainly due to direct exposure to sunlight and high temperature. Go for drip irrigation method for saving water along with its efficient use. \n4. Is it ok to use tap water for watering plants? \nYes, we can use tap water for plants. As it will contain many minerals provided low fluorine content in water. \n5. How much should you water your plants?\nThe amount of water depends on the size, location and type of plants i.e. moisture-loving plants or drought tolerant plants. \n\nUsually, moisture-loving plants require frequent watering when compared to drought-tolerant plants. \nSmall plants require less amount of water due to less root zone and less canopy. \nOutdoor plants require more water than indoor plants. \n\n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot \n\n",

        "articleBody": "Coriander is a herbaceous annual plant. There is no food which is prepared in the Indian culinary without coriander or cilantro. Their fresh leaves, stems and dry seeds are used as herbs and spices all over the world. Both leaves and stems of coriander have pungent flavor. Coriander grows within 40-45 days after sowing of seeds. Being spice and herb it is loaded with many health benefits from keeping your skin healthy to reducing risks of heart problems.  \n\nBotanical information\nBotanical Name: Coriandrum sativum \nFamily: Apiaceae \nCommon names: Coriander, Cilantro, Dhaniya, \nCentre of origin: Mediterranean region \n\nEssentials to grow coriander at home: \n1. Soil: Select well drained fertile and less compact soil or potting mix to grow well. The soil pH can be from 6.5 - 7.0. Make sure the soil you use is organic and has no pathogens and weed seeds. \n\n2. Location: Coriander can be grown in full sun to partial shade. Select well lit area with a minimum of 2-3 hours of direct sunlight. This lush green plant loves sunlight and can be sown under sun for producing good flavored leaves. \n3. Seeds: Select good quality seeds from any trusted source. You can get open pollinated or hybrid seeds online from TrustBasket. \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Water: Water them twice i.e. morning and evening consistently (during summer). Do not let the soil dry completely between watering \nHow to grow and care coriander at home:\n\nTake any pot/grow bag and add organic soil/potting mix for about 20-30 cm. \nIt is always recommended to go for directing sowing instead of the transplanting method when it comes to coriander.\nCrush the coriander seeds to increase the chances of germination and germination rate. You can even use a chapati roller to gently crush the seeds.\nEither sprinkle seeds and cover them with a thin layer of soil or sow them in rows to make them look better.\n\nPrefer to grow in rows to make the process of weeding and harvesting easy.\n\n\n\nNow water them until the entire growing media becomes wet. Maintain the soil moist until seeds germinate and establish well\n\nwatering should be done regularly until the seeds germinate. Because coriander seeds take around 2-3 weeks to germinate.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, water them twice a day until they germinate and establish well.\nDiscard the weak and poor seedlings.\nWater the seedlings carefully. \nWithin 25-30 days after germination, coriander leaves reach maturity.\nNow, these fresh greens are all ready to go into your favorite dishes.\n\nCut the coriander stems at the soil level so that they regrow to offer you few more harvests.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow to grow coriander brought from store: \n\nTake healthy coriander stems that have roots.\nCut the stems leaving 2 inches of stems above the origin of the roots.\nPlant these stems in any fertile organic potting mix at 3-4 inches apart.\n\nUse well drained soil to plant coriander stems as clay soil retains water for long time and result in root rots.\n\nimage source\n\nWater them thoroughly after planting. Thereafter water them when the top inch of soil becomes slightly dry. \nWater plays a major role in keeping these coriander stems alive because it is the only source that allows them to intake nutrients. Leaving the soil dry between watering may damage the cutting as they do not have any leaves to supply food by performing photosynthesis. \nStems may become dry but you will notice the new growth within 7-14 days of planting.\n\nBolting: \nIf you are growing plants for their leaves, bolting is surely a problem in them. The process of production of flowering stake earlier by any plant is known as bolting. When a plant starts producing flowering stake, it stops producing leafy biomass and the taste and flavor of leaves get deteriorated.\nBolting is a natural phenomenon that is adopted by plants to produce their off springs. The main reasons for bolting is to continue its generation, by entering into the reproductive stage when they are in stress. Bolting is good unless you grow plants for their leaves. The plants in which bolting is not appreciated are coriander, spinach, lettuce, and other leafy vegetables. \n\nImage source \nReasons for bolting: \n1. Heat: When plants receive too much of sunlight it forces plant to produce seeds earlier out of stress. So that they produce flowers and seeds to complete its life cycle.\n2. Under watering: When you water your plants less than their requirement, it result in bolting in such plants.\n3. Stress: Whenever plants feel stress due to any reason such as climatic factors, rootbounding, nutrient deficiencies etc. They tend to produce flowers. \nHow to grow coriander seeds:\nWhen you grow coriander to harvest seeds, you need to wait some more days until the plants flower, set seeds. When the green seeds turn yellow- brown, you can harvest the seeds from them. It takes around 90-110 days from seeds to harvest. Meanwhile water them regularly and add any organic fertilizers for every 20 days right from flowering to harvesting. Fertilizing helps in boosting the flowering and seed setting in coriander plants. Follow these care tips if you intend to harvest coriander seeds.\n\n\nCommon pests that damage coriander/cilantro and their damaging symptoms:\n1. Indigo caterpillar: \nIt is velvety, black with yellowish to green stripes. When fully grown, it measures around 3.5 - 4.0 cm.\nDamaging symptoms: \n\nThey feed on coriander leaves making them pale and papery white.\nThey make irregular holes and ultimately skeletonize the leaves leaving veins and petioles.\n\n2. Aphids: \nAphids are the most common garden pests that come from nowhere. They infest the new growth and tender shoots. They mostly reside on the underside of leaves.\nDamaging symptoms: \n\nActively feeds on stems and leaves and result in curling and crinkling of leaves.\nStunts the growth of plants.\n\n\n3. Cutworms:\nCutworms feed on the base of the plants and make them fall. Their infestations at early stages greatly damage the plants and result in serious loss. So keep a regular check on plants.\nCommon diseases to coriander leaves: \n\n\n1. Powdery mildew: \n\n\nIt caused by fungus Erysiphe polygoni. Many white powdery patches on leaves and stems are seen which coalesce to spread all over the leaf and stem surface. \nIt results in deformed leaves, premature sterility, and the absence of seed formation.\n2. Damping-off:\nIt is caused by seed/soil borne fungus. Seedlings/plants wilt and collapse due to rotting at the ground level. It is often followed by root decay. Using healthy seeds and growing media that are free from pathogens is very important to prevent the plants from damping off.\n\n3. Blight: \n\nIt is caused by bacteria and fungus and is associated with the appearance of dark brown spots on stems and leaves.\nHow to control pests and prevent coriander leaves from diseases: \nNeem oil:\nUse neem oil to get rid of common garden pests and diseases. Neem oil not only destroys pests but also keeps them away from your plants. It is an organic insecticide that is completely organic and acts as ovicide, larvicide, bactericide, and fungicide at the same time.\nDosage : 2 - 5 ml/litre. \nApplication: Prune the heavily infected/infested parts and spray neem oil once a week in the morning/evening times after watering the plants.\n \n\nCoriander health benefits to your diet:\nCoriander is a must added spice in Indian kitchens from the ancient times. There is no traditional dish that is prepared without adding cilantro in it. Coriander has wide range of uses due to its flavor and pungency. Apart from its ability to enhance taste and flavors, consuming coriander provides many health benefits. Here are few health benefits that we tried to list. \n\n\nCoriander may reduce bad cholesterol \nCoriander may reduce risks of heart problems.\nIt has anti-inflammatory properties.\nMay boost immune system. \nMay reduce blood sugar levels. \nIt promotes digestion and improves the gut health. \nAntioxidants present in it helps in improving the skin health.\n\nDifference between coriander and cilantro:  \n\n\n\n Coriander \n\n\n Cilantro \n\n\n\n\nCoriander comes from\nCoriandrum sativum \n\nCilantro also comes from Coriandrum sativum \n\n\n\nIn US seeds are called coriander\nLeaves and soft stems are called cilantro \n\n\n\n \nClick here to know how to grow lettuce from seeds.Click here to know how to grow spinach from seeds.Click here to know how to grow fenugreek/methi from seeds.\n\nFAQs Related to Coriander Leaves: \n\n1. Should I soak coriander seeds before sowing?\n\nThere are many ways to germinate &amp; grow coriander seeds. You can sow them directly in soil without soaking or you can go for soaking over night. The main difference between them is when you sow seeds without soaking it takes more number of days to germinate, compared to soaked seeds. One more way is sowing of whole seeds or split seeds. Even here difference exists in number of days to germinate. Whole seeds take more days compared to split seeds. \n2. How long does it take to grow coriander plants from seeds? \nCoriander plants usually take 40 to 45 days to grow and reach harvesting stage. You can start harvesting cilantro or coriander leaves just from 35 days, depending on your purpose of use. \n3. Is coriander easy to grow? \nYes, it is easy to grow coriander plants at your home. Because growing of these greens needs no special skills but few requirements like soil, seeds, light, manure and consistent watering to avoid bolting. \n4. Can I grow coriander from store bought seeds? \nYes for sure, provided they are of good quality. But if you are beginner in gardening, you better go for purchasing seeds from authenticated sellers. Because the seeds bought from the store may not germinate some times. So instead of loosing motivation for growing plants you can start sowing with the good quality seeds.  \n5. What are common pests of coriander? \nUsually leafy vegetables suffer from leaf minors, aphids, white flies and some times cut worms. For controlling all these sucking and cutting pests spray neem oil once a week as a prophylactic measure. \n\n6. How to crush coriander seeds before sowing?\n\nDrop the coriander seeds in any plastic bag. Place the bag on any table/surface. Take a chapati roller or any cylindrical object to crush the seeds. Place the object on the plastic bag that has seeds in it and roll it back and forth gently. By this coriander seeds get crushed slightly. Crushing seeds help in reducing the time of germination of the seeds.\n7. Is it hard to grow coriander?\nIt is always very simple to grow leafy greens like coriander. The only thing that makes growing coriander difficult is, that they always dash to flower and set seeds to pass on to the next generation under stress. Bolting can mostly be avoided by not growing coriander herbs in summers.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot \n",

        "articleBody": "Greens can be grown anywhere if there is an availability of sunlight. Like vegetables or fruits, greens are not heavy feeders. These greens do not require regular fertilizing to reward you with fresh tender leaves. They can be grown anywhere like balcony, terrace, or in your kitchen gardens. Spinach is among those wonderful greens high in fiber, iron, calcium, folic acid, and proteins.\n\nSpinach:\nSpinach is one of the nutritious leafy greens whose leaves are packed with a lot of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It can be either cooked or served raw in salads. Their leaves contain vitamins like  A, B6, B9, C, E, and K1 and are loaded with various health benefits.\n\n\nHealth benefits of spinach: \n\nGood for skin, hair, and bone health.\nReduce the risks of causing cancers.\nLowers blood pressure.\nControls blood sugar levels.\nPrevents constipation and helps in maintaining a healthy gut.\n\n\nHow to grow spinach:\nSpinach is a cool-weather crop yet can be grown all year round except in hot summers. It just takes 40-45 days from sowing to harvest a batch of spinach plants. Let’s look into the requirements that are essential for growing spinach in a completely organic way. \n\n\nRequirements to grow spinach:\n\nBasic gardening tools and watering tools:  such as pruning shears, gardening trowel, fork and cultivator, watering can, pressure sprayer.\nGrow bag/pot/any container that is suitable to grow spinach.\nSoil: Well-drained soil that has pH 6.5 - 7.0.\nSeeds: Seeds from a trusted source.\nSowing time: All year round (except in mid-April to mid-June and mid-November to mid-Feb).\nGermination temperature: 10℃ - 22℃.\nLight: Full sun to partial shade.\n\n\nStep by step guide to grow spinach at your home, terrace or in your balconies:\n\nTake a suitable container and fill it with well-drained soil/potting mix that is organic, fertile, and free of pathogens and weed seeds.\nSway the grow bag/pot to remove the excess air pockets and give a modest press to the soil so that seeds do not move deep when it is watered. \nMake straight rows with the help of a gardening fork if you intend to grow them in rows. \nDrop spinach seeds on those rows and cover them with soil or sprinkle the seeds randomly (without clusters) and cover them with a thin layer of soil., if you do not want to sow them in rows.\n\nNow water the soil thoroughly with the help of a watering can/hose pipe that has a shower nozzle. Watering without the nozzle results in producing holes (sort of) that result in pushing the seeds deep into the soil. It also leads to uneven soil surface.\n\n \n\nPlace the grow bag/pot in partial shade until they germinate. You can even place them in full sun by carefully regulating the moisture level of the soil.\nMaintain the soil moist until the seeds germinate and establish well. \n\nWithin 10- 14 days you could see the germination. After the germination of all seeds, remove the week seedlings and transplant the healthy seedlings into another pot if they are overcrowded.\n\n \n\nFrom now water them only when the top inch layer of the soil becomes slightly dry.\n\nIf maintained properly, spinach leaves will come to harvest within 40-45 days.\n\n\nNow you can either pull them entirely or cut/pinch the leaves above soil level if you intend to get few (two or three) more harvests from them.\n\n\nCaring tips to grow spinach:\n\nKeep a regular check on plants to detect the early signs of diseases and pest infestations. Pull out the diseased or weak plants (if 1 or 2 in number) as they harbor pests and disease-causing pathogens.\nRemove the leaves that are in close contact with the soil to facilitate the healthy growth of plants.\nYou can fertilize (optional) them after one month of sowing with any low concentrated fertilizer like vermicompost (contains water-soluble nutrients) to boost their healthy growth.\nPull out the weeds regularly as they slow down the growth by competing with spinach plants for available water and nutrients in the soil.\nKeep the foliage dry to reduce the risks of pests and diseases.\n\nDo not damage the growing point (base of the plant) while harvesting spinach leaves. Cut/pinch the leaves one or two inches above the soil level to get more harvests from the spinach plants.\n\n \n\n\n\nPests and diseases of spinach:\n\n\nPests that attack spinach: Pests like spider mites, aphids, and flea beetles may attack the plants at any stage of plant growth.Solution: Use neem oil to kill pests and prevent the plants from further infestations\n\n\nDiseases of spinach: Diseases like leaf spot, downy mildew, root rot may cause damage to your plants.Solution: Use neem powder in the potting mix if your soil/garden soil facilitates root rots.Use neem oil to control leafspot and downy mildew as it acts as both fungicide and bactericide. \n\n\nBolting: The phenomenon of producing seeds by a premature plant (producing flowers early) and making it unsuitable for consumption is known as bolting. It occurs when a plant undergoes stress in its growing period. In spinach, this situation generally takes place due to stress factors like inadequate watering, too much sunlight by which the spinach plant starts producing flowers, and a change in the taste and flavor of leaves occurs.Solution: Water them thoroughly and let the soil become slightly dry between watering.Protect these sensitive greens from harsh sunlight (noon light) using shade nets.\n\n\n\nAdverse effects of spinach: \n\nSpinach contains good amounts of calcium and oxalates that are good for bone health. It is not recommended for people who are at risk of developing kidney stones because calcium oxalate present in spinach may lead to acid and mineral salt build-up and result in forming kidney stones in them.\nGenerally, vitamin k1 is essential in blood clotting in our body. People who use blood thinners are not supposed to intake spinach (in larger amounts) as it is rich in vitamin K1.\n\n \nClick here to know how to grow lettuce from seedsClick here to know how to grow methi from seeds\n\nFrequently asked questions: \n1. How long does it take for spinach from seed to harvest?\nIt just takes 40- 45 days when you maintain spinach plants properly by keeping a regular check on pests and diseases. Because pests, diseases, weeds are the main reason to slow down the growth of any plants.\n2. What is the best time to plant spinach seeds?\nSpring is the best time to sow spinach while it can be grown all year round except in hold summers. \n3. When to harvest the spinach leaves?\nYou can pull out or cut the spinach leaves when they are fully grown (around 15 cm). Leaving the leaves to overgrow reduces their tenderness and tastes.\n4. Can I expect a healthy harvest from bolted spinach plants after cutting their leaves and flower stems?\nSpinach is an annual plant that completes its life cycle in one season after producing seeds. If once spinach started producing flowers (contains seeds), the quality of the leaves gets altered making it unsuitable for consumption. So you cannot expect a further harvest from the bolted spinach plants.\n5. Does spinach grow back after cutting?\nYes. spinach does grow back to give you two or three harvests if you do not harm the growing point (base of the stem) of the spinach plants. So cut leaves 1 or two inches above the base of the stems.\n6. Are leaves from a bolted spinach plant poisonous?\nLeaves of a bolted spinach are indeed inedible but they are definitely not poisonous. Their leaves become bitter/tasteless due to bolting as the plant diverts its energy to produce flowers and seeds.\n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot ",

Microgreens should not be confused with sprouts because microgreens have a set of true leaves, a stem, and roots while sprouts are just a germinated seeds that have a shoot coming out of them. Microgreens are completely organic as they are grown without any pesticides. It is impossible to grow any nutritious food without spending much time or money on it. But growing microgreens definitely stands as an exception to this fact \n \nWhat are microgreens?\nGrowing plants (vegetable/herb) up to small heights (2-3 inches) until they develop cotyledon leaves (true leaves)  are considered microgreens. They can be harvested in less than 2-3 weeks depending upon the vegetable/herb you choose to grow. These microgreens have strong flavors and tastes. Initially, these are introduced/used as garnishes but became popular due to their excellent nutritional values. \nImage source\nThese young or micro plants hold the taste/flavor of their mature plants or vegetables e.g. A microgreen of carrot has the taste of carrot while fenugreek has the flavor of fenugreek .Microgreens are loaded with a lot of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, carotenoids and phytochemicals that have numerous health benefits when consumed. Roots of microgreens are also edible along with their leaves and stems. \n\nTypes of micro-greens:\nNot every plant can be grown as microgreens because micro plants of every vegetable do not contain such nutritional benefits. Only certain vegetables/herbs benefit us when grown as microgreens. Some of the popular microgreens among them are\nVegetables:\n\nMost of the Brassicas like mustard, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, kohlrabi, turnips, watercress\nOther vegetables like beetroot, carrot, \n\n\nImage source, \n\nHerbs:\n\nMost of the herbs like spinach, coriander, basil, parsley, dill, amaranth, arugula, celery, lettuce, swiss chard, fenugreek.\n\n\nChives:\n\nOnion, garlic, leek.\n\nLegumes:\n\nChickpea, beans, lentils.\n\n\nCereals:\n\nWheat, barley, oats, maize.\n\nFlowers:\n\nSunflower\n\n \nReasons to grow microgreens:\n\nEasy to grow even without any technical skills.\n\nCan be harvested in less time.\n\nLess soil/growing media: it just requires less than 3 inches of growing media (compost/soil/coco peat).\n\nNeed little sunlight and water.\n\nHave many health benefits.\n\nIncrease the visual appearance of the dishes.\n\nAdd taste to food.\n\n \nNutrition of microgreens:\nNutrient levels of microgreens are many times (2-40 times) higher than their mature counter parts.\n\n\nMicrogreens are packed with vitamins A, C, E, and K.\n\nThey are rich in minerals like potassium, zinc, iron, magnesium, and copper.\n\nThey have carotenoids like β- carotene, lutein.\n\nimage source\nA study has been conducted on 25 commercially available microgreens and concluded that they contain\n \n\n\n\n\nSl.no\n\n\nAntioxidant/carotenoid\n\n\nMg/100 g of fresh weight (FW) of microgreen   \n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\nAscorbic acid\n\n\n20.4 - 147.0\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\nΒ - carotene\n\n\n0.6 - 12.1\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\nLutein/zeaxanthin\n\n\n1.3 - 10.1\n\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nViolaxanthin\n\n\n0.9 - 7.7\n\n\n\n\n5.\n\n\nPhylloquinone\n\n\n0.6 - 4.1 µg/g\n\n\n\n\n6.\n\n\n𝛼 - tocopherol\n\n\n4.9 - 87.4\n\n\n\n\n7.\n\n\n𝛾 - tocopherol\n\n\n3 - 39.4\n\n\n\n\n \nAmong those 25 microgreens, cilantro is rich in lutein and - carotene while red cabbage, cilantro, garnet amaranth, and green daikon radish have higher concentrations of ascorbic acid, carotenoids, phylloquinone, and tocopherols.\n \nHealth benefits of microgreens:\n\nHelp in managing weight \n\nAnti-oxidants that are present in microgreens help in reducing the production of highly reactive compounds (free radicals) which damage cells in our body\n\nHelp in reducing the risks of cancers, heart diseases, and Alzheimer’s diseases. Polyphenols (antioxidants) play important role in reducing these risks. Microgreens that belong to the Brassicaceae family like red cabbage, red and purple mustard, purple kohlrabi, mizuna have high polyphenol content.\n\nHelp in maintaining sugar levels in the body.\n\nImprove heart health.\n\nPrevent chronic diseases.\n\nAct as good detoxifiers\n\nHelp in reducing the destruction of red blood cells by supplying a good amount of oxygen to the blood.\n\n \nHow to grow microgreens: \nGrowing microgreens is so simple that it can be done by anyone from kids to adults. It is such a simple task as it is not associated with any technical skills/knowledge of growing plants. All you need to care about it is, moisture. Yes just by maintaining the growing media moist, you will be rewarded with delicious microgreens whose taste will drive you to grow more and more microgreens.\nEssentials to grow microgreens: \n\n\nSuitable site: Window side (that receives sunlight), balcony, or you can even use grow light to grow microgreens.\n\n\nContainer: Any shallow container\n\n\nGrowing media: Any fertile soil/potting mix/compost you can even use coco peat by mixing it with compost/fertile soil.\n\n\nSeeds:  Seeds from trusted source \n\n\nSteps to grow micro greens:\n\nTake a shallow container and fill it with healthy growing media.\n\nMoist the growing media by spraying water. Image source, image source\n\nScatter seeds all over the surface of the soil.\n\nUse fork/any twig to distribute the clustered seeds.\n\nAdd a thin layer of growing media on top of scattered seeds and give a modest press.  Image source, image source\n\n\nSprinkle some more water to moisten the seeds and added growing media.\n\nPlace the container in a spot where it receives at least 3-4 hours of sunlight.\n\nMaintain the growing media moist (not wet) all the time.\n\nWithin 7-10 days (depends on seeds) all these small seeds will be turned out into closely growing microgreens with a small and lovely set of true leaves. Image source, image source\n\nNow you can uproot and add them to your food after washing them properly. You can even consume the roots as the whole shoot, root and leaves of microgreens are  edible.\n\nAfter harvesting you can start a next set of microgreens by adding some more soil/compost to the existing growing media.\n\nYou can even cut the microgreens with a pair of scissors (above soil level) to get one or more (depends on seeds) harvests from them. Image source, image source \n\n\n \nTips to grow microgreens: \n\nAlways use healthy seeds and growing media to prevent the risks of soil borne or seed borne diseases.\n\nAfter sowing seeds, place weights on top of soil until you notice the signs of germination. This will facilitate the simultaneous germination of seeds.\n\nDo not overwater the growing media as it facilitates the growth of pathogens.\n\nDo not expose the seeds/microgreens to harsh sunlight. Only 3-4 hours of morning/evening sunlight works wondrers for microgreens.\n\nUse clean scissors to harvest microgreens.\n\n \nTime-taken by different microgreens to grow:\nMost of the micro-greens come to harvest within two weeks.\n\n\n\n\nMicrogreen\n\n\nDays of harvest\n\n\n\n\nRadish\n\n\n8-10 days\n\n\n\n\nSpinach \n\n\n10-12 days\n\n\n\n\nBeetroot\n\n\n10-12 days\n\n\n\n\nFenugreek\n\n\n8-10 days\n\n\n\n\nMustard\n\n\n7-8  days\n\n\n\n\nWheatgrass\n\n\n5-7 days\n\n\n\n\nBroccoli\n\n\n10-14 days\n\n\n\n\nRed cabbage\n\n\n10-14 days\n\n\n\n\nRocket (arugula)\n\n\n10-12 days\n\n\n\n\nKale\n\n\n8-12 days\n\n\n\n\nSwiss chard\n\n\n7-12 days\n\n\n\n\nLettuce\n\n\n8-12 days\n\n\n\n\n \nHow to use microgreens:\n\n\nMicrogreens can be used in smoothies\nThey can be used as side dishes\n\nThey can be added in sandwiches, and burgers\n\nThey can be used in soups and salads\n\n  Image source, image source, \n Image source, Image source\nFrequently asked questions:\n1. Is it risky/harmful to eat microgreens?\n\nMicrogreens can make you fall sick if you have grown them using poor/diseased seeds. So always consider buying microgreens seeds from trusted sources. Organic microgreens contain a lot of health benefits in addition to this, they can be added to many of your favorite dishes.\n2. Can we grow microgreens at home?\n\nYes, microgreens can be grown right at your home despite your climate, region, and state. All you need to have are, a container, compost/any organic potting mix, and seeds. Only by having these essentials, you will be rewarded with nutrient-rich microgreens within few days.\n3. Is it costly to grow micro-greens?\n\nNo, growing microgreens is not at all costly as it takes only 2-3 inches of potting mix or soil media which is many times lesser than growing mature plants. And the best part of them is, they worth growing in less time.\n4. Can we regrow microgreens?\n\nWe can regrow few microgreens by cutting the stems instead of uprooting them. When they reach 3 inches (when they develop cotyledon leaves), cut them at the base using scissors. By this you can harvest them again (once or twice). Growing them again and again leads to decrease in nutrient content. So harvest them twice and start growing them again from seeds.\n5. Can you use store-purchased regular grains to grow microgreens?\n\nWhile not all types of grains, but you can grow few microgreens from store-purchased grains. Some of them are fenugreek, mustard, green gram, chick pea, wheat and sunflower.\n6. Are microgreens and baby greens same?\n\nNo, both the microgreens and baby greens are different. When plants develop their first set of true leaves, they are considered microgreens while any stage greater than microgreens and lesser than mature greens are considered baby greens. \n7. How do microgreens are different from sprouts?\n\nMicrogreens have a set of true leaves, a stem, and roots while sprouts are just a germinated seeds that have a shoot coming out of them.\n 8. Do microgreens need a lot of growing media?\n\nMicrogreens just need 2-3 inches of growing media to reward you with nutritious edibles. Any fertile soil/potting mix/compost can be used as growing media to grow microgreens.\n9. Are microgreens safer than sprouts?\n\nYes, the risks of bacterial growth in sprouts are more than that of microgreens. So when compared to sprouts, microgreens are safer to consume. However, the presence of bacteria/pathogens in sprouts/microgreens mainly depends on the type of seeds and growing media you use.\n10. Can we cook microgreens?\n\nMicrogreens can be used to garnish your food but cannot be cooked. They can be eaten raw by adding them to your salads, sandwiches, burgers etc.\n11. What happens if we forget to harvest micro-greens?\n\nYou need not to worry when you forget to harvest microgreens in time. Because you can also grow them to baby greens/mature greens with the same microgreen seeds\n12. Which microgreens have higher nutrient content?Microgreens of the brassicas (red cabbage, kohlrabi), cilantro, radish have higher (nearly 40 times more than their mature counter parts) nutrient content than other microgreens.\n13. Which microgreens can be harvested in less time?\n\nMicrogreens of wheatgrass, mustard, fenugreek, spinach, lettuce can be harvested in less time \n \nReference https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267354000_Microgreens_Assessment_of_Nutrient_Concentrations \n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot \n ",

As a gardener growing vegetables, afruits, and flowers are handy and can produce much more. Along with these greens why can’t we try growing nutrients rich and healthy edible mushrooms at home. Here I will let you know about easy steps to grow oyster mushrooms at your home.\n\nImage source\nMushrooms are not plants but belong to the kingdom fungi. Mushrooms are classified as edible mushrooms and poisonous mushrooms.\n1. Edible mushrooms\nEdible mushrooms will be rich in phenolic compounds, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Majorly there are three groups under edible mushrooms i.e \n\n         Agaricus genus\n\n         Lentinus genus\n\n         Pleurotus genus / Oyster mushroom \n\n\n\nImage source  Agaricus spp.\n\n\n\nImage source Lentinus spp. \n\n\n2. Mushrooms can be dangerous \nSome groups of mushrooms contain a group of toxins called toxic cyclopeptides. Examples are, \n\n          Amanita muscaria\n\n          Amanita virosa\n          Amanita bisporigera\n\n\n\nImage source   Amanita muscaria\n\n\n\nImage source Amanita virosa\n\nHealth benefits of edible mushrooms:\n\nEating of mushrooms provide high energy.\nRich in antioxidants, minerals &amp; proteins.\nImproves heart health.\nEating mushroom may keep you young.\nHelps in the working of the brain as aging occurs.\nMay improve memory.\n\nRequirements to grow oyster mushrooms:\nFor one standard size of polythene bag of 20 x 40 cm you need,\n\nOne kg of good quality paddy straw.\nAbout 100 gm of oyster mushroom spawn\n\n\nImage source       \n\nPolythene bag of size 20 x 40 cm ( opened at both the sides)\nWater\nHydrogen peroxide for disinfecting.\n\nWhere can mushroom grow happily:\n\nTemperature- mushroom grows well under the temperature of 20-37 degrees Celsius.\nMushrooms prefer dark conditions for their growth. Or shade.\nRelative humidity- 80-90%\nSeason to grow : fall and winter season is very good to go\n\n\nFollow these steps to grow mushrooms: \nPaddy straw preparation:\n\nCut the straw about 2 inches long.\nSoak the straw in water for 6-8 hours or overnight. Paddy straw should be completely submerged in water.\nThe next day boil the straw for one hour at 80 degrees Celsius. It means, boil the straw in medium flame for one hour. This stem needed to kill all the other harmful microorganisms present in straw. And to provide soft growing media for the mushroom. \nAfter boiling, clean the indoor surface area with hydrogen peroxide (available in pharmacy ), where you want to spread the boiled straw to drain out the extra amount of water present in the straw.\nDo not dry out straw completely. It should have 50-55% moisture content. To check this condition squeeze the straw hard and no water should come, but your hands should become moist.\nThe straw will be ready to use after 5-6 hours.\n\nPreparing a growing bag:\n\nTake out spawn from the container in a sterilized bowl/ tray.\nTie one end of the polythene bag tightly to give a cylindrical shape to the polythene bag\nFill one-fourth of the straw into a polythene bag\nNow place one-fourth of the spawn into the polythene bag at sides of the wall of the bag, to make the ring of spawn\n\n\nImage source\n\nRepeat this step three more times until spawns are used completely.\nNow press the straw using your palm, tie the polythene bag after removing all the air present in it.\nMake 7-8 small holes using a needle or any sharp tool, ( should be sterilized) holes should be big enough to hold the cotton balls. The reason for inserting cotton balls is to avoid dust to enter inside along with air.\nKeep it in a cool and dark place for about 15 days, after 15 days you can observe white mycelial growth on the straw. It looks like a spider web on the straw.\nThis stage is called spawning. It takes around 15-25 days depending on the temperature.\nAt this stage remove the cotton balls from all the holes.\n3-5 days after spawning you can see the growth of pinheads of mushrooms through the holes you have made earlier.\n\n\nImage source\n\nIt takes 30-35 days to harvest your mushroom from the beginning.\nYou can harvest mushroom three times if you grow it once.\n\n\nImage source \n \nSome precautions to take while growing mushroom @ your home \n\nAlways sterilize the tools you use.\nSanitize your hands when you handle spawns and other media.\nUsing good quality paddy straw makes a difference in the growth of mushrooms.\nSo always prefer high-quality paddy straw and spawns.\nDo not buy mushroom spores, always buy mushroom spawn for better production of mushrooms.\n\nIt is easy to grow oyster mushroom at home provided you maintain the hygienic condition of the place where you grow mushrooms.

Being a queen of flowers, the rose plant is very easy to multiply its number with a simple method. Who does not want these crush flowers in their home in more numbers? Yes, every green thumb likes to have more and more number of these queens in their garden. Here you will get brief information regarding how to multiply rose plants easily at home like a pro gardener.\n \n\nImage source\nRose has hundreds of species and varieties. Botanically rose is Rosa spp. And belongs to the family Rosaceae. This shrub can be propagated in different ways like seeds, cuttings, layering, and grafting. Here I will let you know about how to propagate rose plants by cuttings.\nTools and materials required:\n\na. Mother plant/ matured rose plant\n\n\nSelect well grown robust plant to obtain cuttings from them \n\nb. Pruning scissors\n\n\n Sharp scissors are important to give a slant cut to mother plant and to take cuttings without damaging the main plant\n\nc. Garden tool sterilizer \n\nYou can use any disinfectant to wash tools before pruning operation \n\n\nd. Rooting hormone \n\nAfter taking out the cuttings you have to apply rooting hormone at the end of the cuttings to induce roots, when you plant it in soil.\n\n\ne. Good quality potting mix \n\n\n Potting mix takes an important role in rooting of the cuttings as compact soil may not help cuttings to root well. \n\nf. Rose cuttings\n\nSelect 6-8\" long cuttings of pencil size thick. \n\n \n10 simple steps to propagate rose plants in your home: \n\n\nBest season: Rose roots all round the year, but do best in summer and fall seasons.\n\n\n\nSelection of vigor cuttings: Select the stem of the plant, which has recently bloomed i.e. When flowers are matured and petals are falling off. Because it will have all the vigor to root well in the soil.\n\n\nImage source\n\n\n Length of the cuttings: Flower heads or tips should be removed down to the first pair of healthy leaves. Cuttings should be 6-8’’ in length. Make a clean cut with sharp cutters. Make a cut at an angle of 45 degrees. (Pruning scissor)\n\n\nImage source\n\n\n Favorable condition: In the hot summer, you have to mist over cuttings, to retain the moisture content in cuttings. Make sure not to dry out the cuttings.( Mist nozzle) \n\n\n\n Process of propagation: Take 6-8’’ long cutting, remove all the leaves except one pair of leaves on the top. Scrape the bark at the lower end of the cuttings. Do not cut into the wood, just scrape the bark. Apply some rooting hormone on the scraped surface. That is the place where exactly root development starts.\n\n\nImage source\n    \n\n\n Planting: you can plant the cuttings by leaving 2-3 buds above the ground and 1-2 buds inside the soil. Leave one set of healthy leaves on the bud. Leaving some leaves helps to produce food by photosynthesis and provide energy for rooting. Potting media should be loose, well draining, and rich in all the essential nutrients. ( Potting mix, Perlite, Vermiculite )\n \n\n\n\nImage source\n \n\n\n Watering: Your propagating media should be wet but not soggy/waterlogged. Try not to over water or underwater the cuttings.       \n\n\n\n Light: keep your ready cuttings under bright indirect light, but not under direct sunlight. Periodic misting is much needed to prevent drying out of the rose cuttings. It also improves the rooting of the cuttings.\n\n\n\n Mini greenhouse: You can create greenhouse condition by covering the rose cuttings with water bottle, mind to open the lid (as shown in the figure). Or you can go for covering your cuttings with plastic covers by inserting 3-4 sticks around the cuttings. Do not let too much heat for your cuttings. Better to prevent drying of leaves of the cuttings. For this reason, you can check your mini greenhouse and mist it periodically.\n\n\nImage source\n \n\n\n Rooting: Most of the rose cultivars will root in 10-15 days. Provided wet conditions in the soil media.\n\n\nImage source\n\n\n Replanting: you can replant your cuttings into the main location after 20 – 25 days when there is a good root development.\n\n                        Although it is easy to multiply the rose plants, it is important to take care of new plants those grown out of cuttings. Follow the above-mentioned care tips for your plants and be a pro gardener.\n \n Top questions about rose plants: \n1. How to prune back rose bushes? It is not that difficult to prune rose bushes as you think. When cutting back, pruning or deadheading roses, always use clean, sharp pruning tools. Make cuts at a 45-degree angle just above a leaf set. Major cutting back of a rose bush should be done in late fall or early spring while the plant is dormant. Deadheading or cosmetic pruning can be done at any time, as needed. Roses will benefit from a good hard pruning once a year.\n2. How and when do you fertilize a rose bush?\n In spring, roses need to be fed with a high phosphorus fertilizer. Roses often require extra phosphorus, so treat them with bone meal in midsummer. Fertilizers that contain high nitrogen, the N in NPK, can cause roses to be green and leafy but not bloom properly. When fertilizing roses, try to find a rose food with a higher middle number, like 10-15-10. Spring is usually a good time to fertilize roses or you can also feed your roses with flower booster. 3.Why is my rose bush not blooming?\n There can be many reasons a rose may not bloom. One cause could be too much nitrogen in the soil or fertilizer you are using. Nitrogen promotes lush, green foliage and can cause the plant to put all its energy into the foliage, but not the blooms. Fertilize roses with a fertilizer made specifically for roses for optimum health and growth. Less sunlight can also cause roses not to bloom. Roses need at least six hours of full sun each day. Insects or disease can also prevent blooming in rose bushes. \n4. When and how to transplant roses?\n If roses need to be transplanted, it should be done in early spring before they leaf out. When transplanting anything, pre-dig a large hole where the plant will be going before digging up the plant. This will reduce transplant shock and allow you to investigate the soil in the new site and make amendments if necessary. You can also mix up a batch of water and rooting fertilizer to help the rose plant adjust to its new home. It also helps if you prune back the rose to a height of about a foot; this will cause the plant to put more energy into rooting than leafing and budding. It also eliminates some of the thorns, which can make working with roses unpleasant.\n5.Why are my rose bush leaves turning yellow ? \nYellowing foliage on roses is often a symptom of black spot or any other fungal disease. It may be necessary to cut back this yellow foliage and disposing it immediately to avoid spreading of the disease further. And then treat the whole rose plant with a fungicide like neem oil. Yellowing foliage can also be a sign of a nutrient deficiency. Usually, nitrogen keeps the foliage green and healthy. Nitrogen also gets leached out by repeated watering or frequent rains. If you suspect that your roses are deficient in nitrogen, add some organic manures like vermicompost/ biomanure. or spray the rose bushes with all purpose organic plant nutrients. \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot ",

        "articleBody": "                                       Water is just amazing, it is the basic reason for all the life forms on the earth. Watering your plants requires no technical skill, provided you keep in mind when and how much to water your plants. As light requirement varies with individual plants, and also the water requirement. Every individual plant requires different amount of water. To know this fact first you have to get information on the place of origin of plants or where they belonged to. It is some what like this tropical, temperate and arid regions. \n\nOnce you know the brief information about the origin of plants. Then you are done with the half of the work of watering your plants in the right way. Here we will discuss right time and right way of watering your plants. \n8 Points to consider while watering your plants: \n1. Time of watering\n2. Frequency of watering\n3. Type of plants\n4. Growth season &amp; weather \n5. Size of the container\n6. Watering cans \n7. Placing of plants\n8. Type of soil/ potting mix \n \n1. Time of watering: \nResearch has shown that watering plants early in the morning gives more time for your plants to absorb the water. And retain moisture in its potting media. And there will be very less loss of water through other physiological processes like evaporation and transpiration.\n\n2. Frequency of watering: \nFrequency of watering varies with the different group of plants. Some high water required or tropical plants like ferns require water thrice in a week. Plants that belong to cactus and succulents require very less amount of water. Water those plants once in 10-14 days. So consider where the plants belonged to. \n\n3. Type of plants: \nDifferent group of plants require different type of watering e.g. tropical rain forest plants like ferns require more amount of water compared to drought tolerant plants like anthuriums and peace lily. Plants belonged to cactus and succulents need very less amount of water. hardly once in a month. \n\n4. Growth season and weather:\nYou have to consider weather of a day  and season of plant growth before watering. If the weather is cloudy and drizzling you have to avoid watering plants in that time. As it favors the development of pest and diseases in your plants.\n\n\nSummer days: Usually in summer you have to water your plants everyday or once in two days after checking the soil wetness. It also depends on whether you have kept your plant under direct sunlight or in shade. If it is under sun it requires frequent watering compared to plants that are kept under shade.\n\n\n\nRainy days: In  rainy days, most of the time your plants get water from rain. So approximately you have to water plants once in 5-6 days. Again you have to consider many factors before going for this fixed schedule. Because even in rainy season your plants may not receive good amount of water due to lack of rain. That's why you have to check the soil wetness before watering plants. Be in contact with plants, they tell everything to you. \n\n\n\nWinter days: In winter time, humidity and temperature will be very less. It makes your plant to lose more amount of water especially indoor plants. at homes humidity will be very less, it creates dry condition for plants and result in loss of water through transpiration. So frequently you have to mist your plants to maintain the microclimate around your plants.  \n\n\n\nThumb rule to apply water: Whatever may be the season, the very basic rule to apply water is only after checking the soil wetness. Check soil wetness up to 1.5 to 2 cm by running your index finger into the soil. If you feel the soil is wet you can postpone watering. If you feel the soil is dry you can go for watering your plants. \n\n         \n\n \n\n  \n5. Size of container: \n Size of the pot also matters while watering your plants. Soil stays wet in big sized pot﻿ compare to small pots. Plants which are present in small pots dry more quickly, that's why they require frequent watering. You have to water plants deeply, instead of shallow watering. Water them until water drains out from the pot(through drainage holes).\n6. Watering containers: \n If you consider the size of container while planting your plants it benefits your plants and their growth. It is not wise to use single type large or small container to water all the plants. For example to water a pomegranate shrub or areca plant you have to use big water can. But for leafy vegetables or small seedling you have to apply water in droplets. or water can with nozzle. When you apply water in force with big sized water cans it will physically damage the plant &amp; its growth. So always choose containers according to plant height, size and growth stage. \n\n \n\n   \n7. Placing of plants: \nAmount of watering plants varies with the place you have kept them. Plant that is present completely outdoor or kept under sun requires more water compared to plants which are kept indoor and in shady places. Therefore considering place of pot or plant is a valid thing to do. \n\n \n\n  \n8. Type of soil/ potting mix:\n Soil/ potting mix that has good water holding capacity holds water for long period of time. In that case you have to water such soil or potting mix less frequently. Soil which drains more quickly needs more amount of water. For example red soil drains out water more quickly compared to soil mixed with good amount of organic manure and cocopeat . \n\n \n\n  \n\nTop five questions related to watering of plants: \n1. How to water indoor plants? \n Indoor plants usually require less amount of water compared to outdoor plants. And they need less frequent watering. Use adequate watering cans for watering your indoor plants mainly to avoid the fall of water on the foliage. Divide plants according to their water requirement like low water-loving, more water-loving plants. Apply water twice a week for low water-loving plants. and thrice in a week for high water-loving plants. The thumb rule to water is by checking the soil wetness. Check soil up to 1.5 to 2 inches. If soil is wet do not water them. If it is dry you can go for watering your plants. \n2. What are the methods of watering plants? \nThere is N number of watering methods for plants. But importantly watering methods can be listed as,\na. Manual watering\nb. Drip irrigation \nc. Sprinkler irrigation\nWhen you have only a few plants, a manual method of watering is the best to go for. Drip irrigation is best for both more number of plants and less number of plants. It saves water along with equal distribution of water for every plant. Sprinkler irrigation is good for lawn maintenance, and plantation purposes. \n3. How do you know when to water your plants? \n It is very simple. Think about when did you water your plants last time. The next step is to check the soil wetness with your fingers up to 1.5- 2\", if it is dry just water your plants. \n4. Is it bad to water plants at night?\nWe have to water plants either in the morning or evening. Because it gives more time for plants to absorb water when compared to any other time as the rate of water loss will be very less due to transpiration and evaporation in morning and evening times.. You have to water in the evening not at night because the night temperature will be very less and it may favor the development of diseases and pests in the plants.  \n5. How do you know if you are over watering your plants? \nAn important and basic sign of over-watering is the yellowing of leaves. Sometimes no growth of new leaves, wilting of leaves (due to root rot) also happens. If you observe these symptoms please stop over watering your plants. And give enough time to plant for recovering from damage caused by over watering of plants. \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter.\n \n",

        "articleBody": "Every gardener will have an idea to grow their dream plant in their garden/home/backyard. \nBut the only constrain is climate. \nBecause different plants require different climatic conditions for their growth and flower/fruit production. \nIf you get a chance to grow plants irrespective of their climatic requirement, it seems a dream coming true. \nYes, we can grow plants in unconventional areas. \nHere I will let you know how to provide an artificial environment to grow plants irrespective of their native place. \n\nPlants are adaptable to different climatic conditions. Some plants are very tolerant of harsh sun, like cactus, some plants are tolerant to chilling temperature. According to this adaptability, plants are categorized into sun tolerant, winter tolerant plants. Plants that grow well in Western Ghats cannot grow well in temperate regions. Therefore it is always important to select plants according to your climatic conditions.\n1. Sun tolerant plants:\nIn nature, many plants can tolerate hot sun and grows well in the summer season. You have to select such kind of plants if you are living in high-temperature regions.\nExamples for sun tolerant plants: \n\n\n\n\n Flowering plants   \n\n Vegetables  \n Fruit plants \n\n\n\nHollyhock\n  Sweet potatoes\n Pomegranate\n\n\nButterfly weed\nBeets, cabbage\n Fig\n\n\nFountain grass\nCauliflower, okra\n Guava\n\n\nCana lily\nCorn, peas\n Mango\n\n\nRhododendron\nCucumber\n Ber \n\n\nLimelight crop\nSpinach, squash\n Papaya \n\n\nLantana\nBell pepper, hot pepper.\n Carambola \n\n\nPurple coneflower\n Eggplant\n Banana \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n 2. Winter tolerant plants: \nThere are certain plants which are adapted to low temperature, you have to select such kind of plants if you are living in low-temperature region. Some of the examples are as follows, \nExamples of winter tolerant plants: \n\n\n\nFlowering plants\n Vegetables\n Fruit plants/ trees \n\n\nPansy\nCarrot\n Apple\n\n\nWintergreen boxwood\n\nCelery\n\n Pear\n\n\nCoral bells\nCollards\nPeach\n\n\nBlue spruce\nGreen onions\nPlum\n\n\nPrimrose\nTurnips\n Kiwi\n\n\nHostas\nRadishes\n Cherry \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhatever may be the climate and weather condition in your region, in nature certain plants adapt to specific climate and weather. If you want to succeed in gardening you need to select the right plants for your place. \n\n Controlled/ artificial environment: \nIf you want to grow the plants in unconventional areas. Then you have to follow certain tips. For example, if you are living in Karnataka and want to have a bunny ear cactus in your home, you can keep it. But as you know cactus are desert plants. So you have to provide similar conditions at your home for growing those plants. \nArtificial environment for cactus: \n\n\nCactus wants very little water (tolerant to water scarcity)\nNeeds dry potting media, low humid conditions. \nSo In your home, you have to artificially provide all these requirements.\nYou have to water only once in three to four weeks.\nPlanting in a well-draining potting mix.  \n\nAnd to keep in well-aerated and under good light condition. This is called providing an artificial environment for your plants. \n\nIn the same way, if you are living in Rajasthan and you would like to keep orchid plants in your home. Then you have to provide the required environment that orchids want to grow. \nArtificial/ controlled environment for orchids:\n\n\nOrchids need high humidity of 60-80%,\nLetting the potting medium dry between watering;\nIt doesn't like to sit in the waterlogged situation,\nFull sunshine,\nAnd a good amount of orchid's food.\nMist (spray bottle) your plants frequently to maintain the humidity level in your home.\nAnd using perforated pots or slit pots with some barks, charcoal, and wood chips.\nExposing the plants to a good amount of partial light can enhance their growth.\n\nSo whichever plants you select, you have to provide artificial climate according to the plants. If you want to go for very hardy or drought tolerant plants follow these measures.\nCare for hardy and drought tolerant plants: \n\nYou have to keep them in well lit area,\nProvide good sunshine,\nApply water according to their requirement,\nDo not over water,\nUse good draining potting mix along with good amount of manure.\n\nCare for humidity loving plants:\n\nIf you have decided to grow humid loving plants, then you have to provide artificial humidity by using some humidifiers.\nWater those plants consistently,\nDo not keep those sensitive plants directly under sunlight as it may scorch the leaves of plants.\nProvide organic manure twice in a month for robust growth. \n\nIf you want to check whether a plant can survive in your region the best thing to do is bring/select a plant according to your climate and see whether that plant can survive or not. Do not bring more plants of the same kind. Always check a single plant. If it grows well, then go for buying more plants. So if you are ready to provide this artificial environment for your plants you can grow any plants irrespective of where you live. \n\nFAQs Related to Adaptability of Plants:\nWhat temperature is the best for growing plants?\nPlants prefer an optimum temperature of 20 to 32 degrees Celsius for their growth. They always perform better during this range of temperature. If you are living in this temperature zone, you can grow plants successfully with very little effort.\nAt what temperature plants perform higher photosynthesis?\nPhotosynthesis refers to the process of the production of food in plants. Plants need many ingredients to produce their own food. The ingredients are water, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and chlorophyll. At a temperature of 24-28 degrees rate of photosynthesis will be best.\nCan we grow succulent plants at less than 10 degrees Celsius?\nCactus and succulents are hardy plants, that can tolerate very high and low temperatures. These plants are desert plants. In deserts usually, the temperature will be very low during night and very high during daytimes. So cactus and a succulent group of plants have the ability to adapt to the very low and high temperature. Therefore the answer is yes.\nWhat is the maximum temperature tolerance for vegetables?\nIn vegetables, there are many categories. Few vegetables are very sensitive to heat and few vegetables are sensitive to cold temperature. Generally speaking, vegetables grow well up to 30-35 degrees Celsius. But vegetables like onions do well even at temperature more than 35 degrees Celsius.  \nWhat are the best vegetables for hot weather?\nMany vegetables perform well under high temperatures. Examples are Sweet potatoes, beets, corn, peas, okra, bell pepper, cucumber, etc.\nWhat are the best flowering plants for hot weather?\nMany flowers perform well under high-temperature examples are Hollyhock, purple coneflower, rhododendron, Cana lily, butterfly weed, limelight crop, lantana.\nWhich fruit plants grow best under high temperatures?\nFor successful growing of fruits under high temperature go for selecting hardy and drought tolerant fruits. Some of the examples are pomegranate, fig, guava, Ber, papaya, carambola, banana, and mango.\nCan we grow flowering plants under very low temperatures?\nFor sure yes, because as we discussed in the blog there are different plants that are adapted to different climatic conditions. Some grow well under high temperature, some grow well under low temperature. It is same for flowering plants as well. Examples are pansy, wintergreen boxwood, blue spruce, primrose, Hostas.\nDo we get a good yield of vegetables under low temperatures?\nThe yield of vegetables, flowering plants depends on many factors like fertility of the soil, water, sunlight, temperature, and weather. You have to select plants according to the weather and season. In cold regions or under low temperatures, certain plants like carrot, collards, celery, green onions, radishes, and turnips perform well.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot",

        "articleBody": "                                   Winter is the season where plant dies easily compare to any other seasons like summer and rainy days. Low light, less humidity or dry air, low temperature and shorter days drastically reduces growth of your plants. Plants may die if you are not taking care of them. The secret to help your plants lies in adjusting the care routines according to plant growing season. Let's say creating micro climate around your plant to make it congenial for growth. \n\n \nIn winter usually natural light, temperature, and humidity in your home will be very low. So this condition is not good for any plant to grow. To support the growth of your plants, you need to help your plants. you can bring your plants indoors and follow these measures.\n \nLow light: \nWhen the availability of natural light is very low in winter, follow the below simple steps to help your plants to harvest more light.\n\nMove the indoor plants near to window in the day time to harvest more light. \nClean the window glass for maximum transmission of light inside the home.  \nWash off the dust on plant leaves to make use of the maximum amount of light. You can do this both in indoor &amp; outdoor plants.\nGive a slight turn to your plants everyday so that every stem and leaf gets its turn to receive the sunlight. this also avoid the improper growth (growth of particular stems/branches) of the plant.\n\n         \n\nProvide artificial lights to increase the light hours for plants and to support the growth.\n\n         \nLow temperature :\n\nAvoid placing plants near to the window at night\nYou can use the frost-resistant planters for extreme winter days\nYou can go for greenhouse conditions for increasing the temperature and to reduce the side effect of low temperature for outdoor plants.\n\n\nWatering:\n\nDo not add much water to your plants in winter. Because their growth will be slow in winter except for a few winter plants.\nPlease check the soil wetness up to 1.5 cm depth if it is dry then only water it. In winter many plants need dry soil between watering.\n\n         \n\nBut it is not always true; some plants need consistent moisture throughout their growing season. If you are in dilemma concerning some plants. You have to research before going ahead.\n\nMisting: \n\n\n﻿Air becomes too dry in winters, but plants need certain humidity (moisture %in air) to survive well. misting around the plants helps in maintaining the humidity levels required for the plants.\n\nimage source\n\n\nFertilizer:\n\nDo not apply fertilizers during the winter (except for winter vegetables &amp; flowers) because their growth will be slow during this time. So you can apply fertilizers in the spring when the growth kick starts.\n\n         \n\nYou can do a pinching or pruning process in the winter to support the bushy growth. In winter the plant system will not be affected by pruning due to low metabolic activities in the winter.\n\n         \nPesticides: \n\n\nEven though the plants are indoors, pest attack might takes place.\n\n\nIn winters pests reside/hide in different parts of the plant to escape from vision. Observe the plant keenly for any abnormal symptoms like curling of new growth or drying of plant parts.\n\nSpotting of pests is often a problem in winter. Look at leaf bases, lower side of leaves, and nodes to spot pests.\nSpray neem oil solution to affected plants, yellow sticky traps also works well to trap sap sucking aphids and thrips. \n\nWatering, fertilizer and pesticide application will be same for indoor/outdoor plants. in addition to that some extra care should be taken for outdoor plants.\nWinter care for outdoor plants:\nIf your plants are in soil or in heavy pots it is impossible to move them indoors. Here are some tips to protect them from cool temperatures in winters. \n\nCover your plants with any material like plastic covers/containers, cloths, cardboards to protect them at nights from cold temperatures.\nYou should do it by tenting.\nRun 3-4 sticks around plant/bush that you want to protect.\nMake holes on materials you use for aeration.\nNow cover the plant by wrapping the material around sticks.\nMake sure you leave some gap (1-2 inch) at the bottom/base of the plant.\nYou can cover the seedlings/small plants by inverting any container(pots/cardboards/plastic/glass containers) on them at nights.\n\n\n\nimage source image source\n\nYou can also wrap a plastic around your shrubs/bushes by tying it with any string. Or you can also go for protective covers that are readily available.\nIf you want to protect more number of plants at once. You can cover them all by making tents on rows.\n\n\n\n\nimage sourceimage sourceBy this you can protect your plants outdoors. This protective cover can be removed at the day time (if it is opaque/covered tightly), so that plants receive maximum sunlight.\n\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. Can I add fertilizer to plants in winter?\nUsually fertilizers are added to plant in their growing seasons to provide required nutrients for their growth and development. In winters, growth of plants will be low i.e. their metabolism slows down. Adding fertilizers in this time yields nothing instead it may lead to loss of leaves in plants(especially succulents).\n2. How should I maintain humidity levels for plants in winter?\nYou can place the pots in trays filled with water and pebbles to maintains the humidity levels in winters. Or you can just go for misting around your plants.\n3. How should I water my plants in winter?\nWater them sparingly. As the metabolism rate of the plant slows down, regular activities like transpiration respiration, photosynthesis will be lowered. So plants do not require much water for their survival during winters.\n4. Should I bring my plants indoors during winters?\nYes. It is always better if you can move your plants indoors during winters. This avoid the plants being exposed to cold temperatures, by which leaves dry out.\n5. Do plants hibernate in winters?\nMost of the plants go inactive (low metabolism) in winters, in plants we call it as dormant period. Plants should not get disturbed by over watering/fertilizing at this period. So do not fertilize them and water sparingly during winters.\n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot \n",

        "articleBody": "Most of the people know how to grow plants. But they are not sure about the problems that plants face while growing. So keep on reading to get more information about essential nutrients and plant's unusual behavior regarding their growth and some of the visual symptoms that plants show.   \n\nIf you observe the below two plants. You can see the difference in the physical appearance of them. First plant is not normal, it is looking yellow, leaves are not well developed and some leaves are looking burnt.\nBut the other plant looks very healthy with well developed green color leaves.\n\nThe main reason for these differences is the absence of nutrients in plant one. And the presence of all the nutrients in plant two. \n\n\n\nYes, nutrients make all the difference. When plants do not get the major essential nutrients, they will show predominant symptoms like yellowing of leaves, burning of leaves, etc.  \n\nLike human beings, plants also need nutritious food for their growth. Here nutritious food refers to organic manure or vermicompost or some other bio manures which has most of the essential nutrients in them.\n  \nNutrient deficiency symptoms in plants:  \nPlants want all the nutrients to grow well. And if they do not get some nutrients for some reason, they will start telling you that they are deficient in nutrients. Plants express their need through some of the visual symptoms like\n\nYellowing of leaves, discoloration of leaves into different colors.\nBurning of leaf edges\n\nWhen you provide good nutrition for your plants, they will fight against pests and diseases. And show the best growth. One more advantage of providing nutrients to plants is, it increases the yield of the plant. Yield means the number of flowers and fruits it produces.\nWhen you apply organic manures to your plants. They will be happy, healthy, and show faster growth. Moreover, plants will not suffer from the deficiency symptoms. That's why nutrients rich organic manures are important to provide essential nutrients for plant growth and development.\n\nNutrient requirement for plants: \n\nNutrition is required for plant vigor\nRequired for increasing tolerance to pest and diseases\nTo increase the yield of your crop plants\nFor faster growth\nFor maintaining good health of plants\nTo avoid deficiency of nutrients\n\n\n \nBio organic manure \nClassification of nutrients based on plants requirement: \nIf we look deep into the plant nutrients. They can be categorized into three different groups based on the requirement for plants.Plant nutrients can be classified as,\n\nMacronutrients,\nMicronutrients &amp;\nBeneficial elements\n\n1.Macronutrients: plants need these nutrients in large quantities. And these are very basic nutrients and important for plant growth.Examples are Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), and Sulfur (S).\n2.Micronutrients: Plants require these nutrients in minute quantityEx: Boron (Bo), Zinc (Zn), Manganese (Mn), Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), Molybdenum (Mo), Chlorine (Cl), Nickel (Ni). Macro and micro nutrients are together known as essential nutrients of plants.3.Beneficial elements: These kinds of nutrients are required for increasing growth speed and increasing the quality of fruits and flowers. Examples are: Aluminum (Al), Cobalt (Co), Sodium (Na), Selenium (Se), and Silicon(Si).\nSources of nutrients: \nThere are many sources for organic manure for your plants. We will look into them one by one.\n\nThe first one is the livestock manure.            \nLivestock manure includes cow dung, sheep manure, goat manure, and chicken manure. These can be applied to your plants after composting them for few days.                   \n\n      \n\nThe next source of organic manure is vermicompost. You might know vermicompost. Let me tell you it is one of the best organic manure for plants. Vermicompost is the castings of earthworms. It will be rich in most of the nutrients that are important for your plants. Farmers usually prepare it for their farms. But in urban areas, there are many options to buy vermicompost.to provide essential nutrients for your plants.\n\n\n\nOne more important source of organic manure is home compost. It is the cheapest source of manure and can be prepared by anyone at your home. Vegetable, fruit waste, dry leaves &amp; some bio-waste can be used for composting at home. There are many ways to do composting but we recommend you bokashi method.\n\n\nRight method of manure application: \n Applying all the manures at once is the wrong method of manure application to  plants. When you supply all the manures at once. It will not be absorbed by plants. At any given time, only a small portion of it is absorbed by the plants. The remaining portion will be leached out through the drainage holes. That's why the right method and right amount of manure application is important  \n\nYou have to apply manures to plants in their growing season. During their growth time, they need maximum nutrients. That's why always give nutrients when plants need them. \n\n\n\nUsually, most of the vegetables and flower plants start growing in the spring. So one month before spring is the best time to apply manure or nutrients. We are giving one month for organic manure to supply essential nutrients in the spring. \nSplit the total amount of manure into smaller parts. Then apply them in different growing seasons of the plants.\nIf you want your plants to efficiently use the applied fertilizers, then you have to apply fertilizers in split doses. It means to split the total quantity of manure of a plant into three parts. And then start to apply one part of the manure at the start of spring, one part at the end of summer, and the other at the start of winter. This is the best way to provide essential nutrients to your plants and get the maximum out of them. \n\n\n \n Most frequently asked questions: \n 1. What nutrient is most important for a plant's growth? \nPlants need most of the nutrients for their growth. Major nutrients for plant growth are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium. They make NPK and primary nutrients for the plant's growth. Along with NPK, plants also need calcium, magnesium, and Sulphur, boron, etc. to grow well.  \n2. How should I provide nutrients for plants?\nThere are many methods to apply nutrients to plants. One such way is you can either apply organic manure to the soil or spray liquid fertilizer to the foliage of plants. If you are decided to apply chemical fertilizers for plants, dig the soil and add fertilizers into that, and cover it with soil. after applying organic or chemical fertilizers cover them with soil and water them thoroughly. \n3. Which is the best time to apply fertilizers/ manures for plants?\nPlants do not need nutrients during all the seasons of the plant's growth. They need nutrients only when they are in growing phase. Most of the flowering plants and vegetables grow in the spring season. In India, the spring season refers to February to March. Apply manures before the onset of the spring.\n4. How many nutrients are necessary for plants' healthy growth? \nPlants require 17 essential nutrients along with light, water, and carbon dioxide for their healthy growth and development. 17 essential nutrients can be categorized as macronutrients and micronutrients. \n5. Which nutrients are necessary for flowering?\nDifferent nutrients play different roles in the growth and development of plants. Some nutrients are responsible for the growth of foliage, some nutrients are responsible for the development of flowers, and some others for root growth. Nutrients that are necessary for flower production in plants are phosphorus, potassium, calcium &amp; Sulphur. \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter, Buy Pots Online, Indoor Plant Pots, Metal Flower Pot \n ",

        "articleBody": "Introduction\n\nGardening provides a relaxing environment to relieve daily stress and acts as a buffer zone to improve mental wellbeing. Due to the ever-increasing population and dense urban cities, our innate connection with nature usually gets lost. Having a garden acts as a bridge to bring us closer to nature and provides comfort.\nFor a city dweller, the choices for the type of garden becomes limited due to constraint of space. For people living in apartments and residents with balconies, they are limited to having a garden in their balcony or terrace.\nDue to the limited space of a balcony, it comes with its own challenges like the limitation of the choice of plants due to direction, sunlight and season. Although a well-researched person can overcome this and when done correctly you could reap the benefits of any other garden.\nGet your place ready\nLocation of your garden is crucial yet this is one of those aspects which is out of one’s control. Location dictates the type of plants one can have.\n\nEast-facing Balcony: If one has the freedom to choose the location an east-facing balcony is recommended for shade-loving plants. As it will provide ample direct sunlight for a period of 6-7 hours and indirect light after 12 PM. It can also protect plants which are sensitive to the scorching heat of the afternoon sunlight.\nWest-facing Balcony: If you are stuck with a west-facing balcony your choice of plants becomes limited. It is wise to choose hardy drought-proof and heat-tolerant varieties of plants.\nMaximize the space\n\nNarrow and long garden plant pots are advisable for tall and lanky plants as these help in saving space. Choosing the pot based on the growth rate and density of plant is the best form of space saving one can achieve.\nMultiwall pocket planters are the best way to save space without limiting your planting space. This also adds a lush green look due to it being planted proximately to each other in contrast to the dispersed look of potted plants\nHanging planters from the ceiling is another form of efficient space management. You can visit TrustBasket Garden Store online to find your choice of balcony hanging pots.\n\n\nDesign garden for balconies\nWhen it comes to design, you should let your imagination flow and observe what works for you based on the space available. You can later integrate your ideas with other elements like functionality and comfort. \n\n\n Vertical gardens are the latest trend when it comes to saving space without sacrificing the planting space. The systems incorporate potted plants placed on vertical racks arranged in the form of rows and columns. They usually place shade-loving plants at the bottom and light-loving plants at the top for the best growth patterns and lush look.\n The most popular method of garden design usually involves potted plants, hanging plants, creepers, etc. Adding decorative pots and painting your garden section in a different tone to separate and highlight the area are some of the ideas widely used.\nOne could always get design inspirations from social media sites like Pinterest and Instagram.\nFacebook groups are another source for meeting fellow gardeners to exchange ideas, tips and share experiences.\n\n\nPlanters and pots\n\nThere are different types of planters that are easily available from online e-stores that sell them these days with doorstep delivery. The planters and pots are usually made of clay, cement and plastic. There are also ceramic pots in myriad colours and designs that bring in an element of interest to your garden. These planters are available in various sizes and shapes. The ones you choose should depend upon the type and need of the plants you are going to grow in it.\n Cement pots are more durable and they are recommended for big plants that are heavily root intensive.\n The trend right now is to grow pots in traditionally crafted clay pots. These pots come in various designs.\nThe most important aspect when it comes to any planters is the drain. Look for holes at the bottom of the pots which are meant to let out excess water and prevent waterlogging.\nSpace also dictates and limits the options of pots. The shape of the garden plant pots can limit or expand the options of plants you can have in your balcony garden.\n\n\nSoils for planting\n\nA well-draining soil is the go-to for healthy plant growth. Water stagnation due to poor soil can prevent oxygen exchange between soil and air. A well-draining soil allows water to percolate through it easily.\nA good potting mix for a well-draining soil can be made using a mixture of any of the following materials like coco fiber, perlite, sphagnum moss, vermiculite, compost or sand with your regular soil.\n\n\nPreparing seeding\n\nGrowing plants from seeds depend on temperature and humidity. Each type of seeds whether herbs, flowers or vegetables have their unique germination period and temperature requirements that need to be met.\nWhen it comes to vegetables, seeding them based on the season is the right approach as external temperatures largely dictate its growth and harvest. Doing the research on the type of vegetable that you’re going to grow saves you time and effort.\nThe exception is perineal vegetables which can be planted at any time of the year. They are usually hardy.\nThe type of plant dictates the planting space and supporting structures. Plants like beans and tomatoes etc., require trellises.\n\n\nWatering\nThe watering schedule depends on the season. During the rainy and winter season water requirement for your garden will be very low. During this period watering once or twice a week would suffice. While in hot conditions your plants would require daily watering. And the intensity and depth of your watering depend on the type of plant and its requirement. If it is a water-hungry plant, like iris and sedges, they will require heavy watering compared to drought-tolerant plants like cactus or succulents\n\nMaintenance\n\nRemoving dead and dying leaves.\nProviding mulch to reduce evaporation and maintain soil humidity\nPruning branches to shape your plant to your liking and to prevent it from shading plants out of sunlight.\nProviding organic or inorganic fertilizers when the deficiency is observed in your plants\nRegular checking of the drainage of the planters and making it clog proof.\n\n\nAt TrustBasket, we offer a wide range of balcony railing planters, wall-mount planters, balcony hanging pots, and space-saving outdoor plant pots that are perfect to create greenery in your home.

Direct application of ash \nIn this method, you have to just sprinkle a handful of ash to the soil. Or put ash as a very thin layer of mulching. Avoid applying on the foliage of plants.\n\n\nImage source\n2. Composting of ash\nIn this method, we try to compost the ash instead of applying it directly. You can put wood ash into the compost bin along with other organic wastes. In composting usually pH becomes slightly acidic. Addition of ash to compost bin fix this problem. And ash releases some of the major nutrients for the plants. Either way, you can use ash in your garden.

If you grow these plants you can apply ash in a limited quantity.\nPrecautions to be taken before applying ash:\n\nBefore the application of ash in your garden soil, check soil pH. If it is acidic then only you can go for the application of ash. Otherwise, it retards the availability of some nutrients to the plants.\nNot recommended to apply for acid-loving plants like rose, hibiscus, blueberry, strawberries, tomato, corn, carrots, radish, and sunflower.            ( vegetable seeds ) Because the application of ash to these crops retards the growth of plants.\nUse wood that is not chemically treated or painted, otherwise, it may contaminate soil and hurt plants.\nDo not apply an excessive amount of ash for any plants that may hinder the growth of plants.\nIf any ash present on leaves while applying, try to remove it by spraying water.                                                                                                            Any organic matter can be used as a compost for your plants. But be selective with respect to plants for which you apply. Use wood ash with all the precautions as mentioned above and reap the benefits of plant food rich ash. \n\n\nFAQs about the application of ash for plants: \n1. Which plants like wood ash?\nUsually, some plants acidic soil conditions or lower pH, and some other plants love alkaline conditions or higher soil pH to grow well and bear flowers and fruits. Plants like onion, garlic, leek, spinach, lavender, beans, mango, kale, lilac like alkaline conditions for growing. If you are growing these plants you can apply wood ash for them. \n2. When should I add wood ash to my garden?\nWood ash is a rich source of potassium and phosphorous. These nutrients are very much beneficial for flowering and fruiting plants to increase the quality of flowers and fruits. When the soil pH is below 6.5 you can apply wood ash to increase the soil pH. But be aware of acid-loving plants. Because ash might reduce the growth of acid-loving plants. plants. \n3. How much wood ash is good for the garden?\nThe quantity of wood ash varies with the type of soil and the crop or plants you have decided to grow. Generally, clay soils tolerate more wood ash compared to sandy soil. 7-9 kg of wood ash per 1000 square feet area is fine to apply. \n4.

        "articleBody": "                                                    Every one of you wants your plant to grow well and bear a good number of fruits and flowers. The healthy growth and production of flowers and fruits mainly depend on plant nutrition. It depends on growing media, and type of fertilizers, provided all other growth factors are optimum.\n\n \nWhen we experimented on the effect of chemical fertilizers and organic manure on plant growth. We got a great difference in the growth of the two plants. We selected two marigold plants of the same age and the same growth rate. We applied chemical fertilizer to plant 1 and organic manure to plant 2 and watered well and kept under sunlight. We let them grow for two months.\n    \n \nThe result after two months: \nAfter two months we observed that both plants were growing well. But the only difference was the number of flowers. For plant one we applied chemical fertilizers, but for plant 2 we applied organic manure.\n\n\n\nSl. no \nElements\nPlant one\nPlant two \n\n\n01.\nFertilizer\nChemical \nOrganic manure\n\n\n02.\n Growth of plant\nGood \nGood\n\n\n03.\nNumber of flowers\nComparatively less\nMore \n\n\n\n \n \nReason for difference:  \nThe main reason for the difference in flowering was the type of fertilizers we used. Chemical fertilizers provided only specific type of nutrients to plants like NPK, which means nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. But plants want all other nutrients to grow well and bear a good number of flowers and fruits. So plant 1 got only a few nutrients from chemical fertilizer and plant 2 absorbed most of the nutrients from vermicompost. Like human beings even plants need balanced nutrition for their healthy growth and survival. That's why the classification of nutrients based on the requirement of the plant becomes important. \n \nClassification of nutrients: \nBased on the requirement of plants, nutrients can be classified into three different groups, they are\n1. Macronutrients\n2. Micronutrients\n3. Beneficial elements \nPlant nutrition can be compared with the human diet. Plants want macronutrients in more quantity. So macronutrients can be compared with rice and chapatti, as we eat them in more amount plants also need them in more quantity. Examples of macronutrients are \n\nNitrogen (N): it helps in vigorous vegetative growth of plants. And it is responsible for green lush color of the plant\n\n\nPhosphorous (P) : very much important in formation of sugars and starch in plants.\n\n\nPotassium (K): K is responsible for robust growth of plant and helps your plant to fight against pest and diseases. \n\n\nCalcium (Ca): Ca is a secondary nutrient. It takes an important role in the formation of cell wall and cell membrane \n\n\nMagnesium (Mg): important component of chlorophyll. Deficiency of Mg causes yellowing of leaves \n\n\nSulfur (S): helps plants to fight against stress caused by pests. important for synthesis of oil in oil crops.  \n\n\nPlants also need micronutrients in small quantities. These nutrients can be compared with sweets. Because we like to eat sweets but in small quantity. Examples of micronutrients are \n\nZinc ( Zn): Zn is important in formation of chlorophyll and helps plant to fight against stress caused by cold temperature\n\n\nCopper(Cu): Cu has very important role in photosynthesis and fighting against stress. \n\n\nManganese: has role in photosynthesis process \n\n\nBoron: Bo has a very important role in reproductive growth stage of plants. \n\n \nBeneficial elements can be compared with pickles and ghee. Because we can finish our food without these but still we want them for our better taste and satisfaction. In the same way, plants also want these beneficial elements for the production of better quality fruits and flowers. Beneficial elements increase resistance in plants against diseases and damage caused by insect pests, show robust growth. \nWatch this  video, where we explain plant nutrients in detail \n\nRole of nutrients in the plant's life cycle: \nPlants want all types of nutrients to complete their life cycle. The life cycle of a plant includes seed, germination, seedling stage, juvenile stage, and reproductive stage.\nDifferent growth stages of plants: \n\nSeed: seed is a matured ovule consisting of embryonic plant along with stored food. It is the basic material required to start planting. \n\n\nSeedling: small young and delicate plants grown out immediately from seeds. \n\n\nJuvenile stage: the stage of plant growth between seedling and reproductive stage. \n\n\n\nReproductive stage: it is the flower and fruit initiation stage of plants. Here plants are able to bear good number of flowers and fruits. \n\n A plant wants all these nutrients i.e. macronutrients, micronutrients, and beneficial elements to enter into all these stages and to complete its life cycle. That's why it is very important to provide all the nutrients for your plants to support their healthy growth. \n\nNutrients can be applied to plants in two different ways. One such way is providing nutrients through the application of chemical fertilizers. Another way is through the application of organic manures. \nDisadvantages of chemical fertilizers: \nApplication of chemical fertilizers is easy but it provides only a few nutrients to your plants and they act like incomplete food for plants. Chemical fertilizers can be compared with protein powder or protein tablets which provide only protein for us but for better health and survival we want all other nutrients like carbohydrates, lipids, minerals, and vitamins. We get these nutrients by eating complete food like fruits, vegetables, meat, and milk. Therefore chemical fertilizers are not wholesome food that provides all the nutrients for plants. \n\nOne more drawback of applying chemical fertilizers to your plants is it will gradually kill all the beneficial microorganisms and makes your soil dead. Unknowingly if you apply chemical fertilizers in excess, it may harm your plant. Sometimes it will burn your plant. It is like when you take protein powder or tablet in excess it creates some side effects to you. In the same way, excess chemical fertilizers will have negative effects on the plant's development. \n \nAdvantages of organic manures over chemical fertilizer: \nSo instead of chemical fertilizers, another chemical free method is to go for organic manures. Because\n\n Organic manures act like complete food for plants and provide most of the nutrients as compared to chemical fertilizers.\n\n\nAnd will not make your soil toxic over a period of time.\n\n\n Helps to build up healthy microbes in the soil. \nEven if you apply organic manure in excess it will not harm your plants as chemicals. Plants will absorb how much they want and the remaining will be in the soil. \nWhenever they want nutrients, they will absorb from the soil sometimes nutrients will leach out from the soil if you over water your soil. \n\n\nIf you eat fruits and vegetables in excess they will not affect your health, except for some kind of uneasiness. Therefore the best way to provide most of the nutrients to your plants is by organic manures or vermicompost. Organic manures provide most of the nutrients if not all. So we recommend you ecofriendly and chemical-free fertilizers i.e. organic manures. \n \nDifference between fertilizer and manure: \n\n\n\nSl. no\nFertilizer \n Manure \n\n\n\n01.\nFertilizer may be artificial or natural substance \nManure is natural substance\n\n\n02\nObtained by synthesis of different chemicals\nObtained by plant and animal sources \n\n\n03\nPrepared in factories \nPrepared in fields \n\n\n04\nQuick release of nutrients \nSlow release of nutrients\n\n\n05\nLoss of nutrients through volatilization \nNo such loss of nutrients \n\n\n06\nContinues use makes soil toxic \nIt will improve soil texture, will not make soil toxic \n\n\n07\nIt may kill healthy microbes present in soil\nManure supports growth of healthy microbes \n\n\n08\nProvides only few nutrients \nComparatively provides more number of nutrients \n\n\n09\nPrice wise costly \nCheaper compare to chemical fertilizers\n\n\n10\nFertilizers will not add humus to the soil\nManures add humus to the soil \n\n\n\n \nPreparation of organic manure ( Vermicompost) in the farm:\nOrganic manures in the farm is prepared in the same way as it is prepared in its natural habitat like a forest. The soil which is present in the forest will be having most of the nutrients that plants want to grow well. So on the farm, we will try to mimic the natural habitat of plants and produce wholesome food which is important for plants' growth and development. \nProcedure\n\n\nFor preparing vermicompost, either a plastic or a concrete tank can be used. The size of the tank depends upon the availability of raw materials like cow dung, straw, etc: \nCollect the biomass and place it under the sun for about 8-12 days. Now chop it to the required size using the cutter. Cutting biomass helps earthworms for faster conversion of waste into nutritious compost. \nPrepare a cow dung slurry and sprinkle it on the heap for quick decomposition. Which we kept under the sun. \nAdd a layer (2 – 3 inches) of soil or sand at the bottom of the tank.\nNow prepare fine bedding by adding partially decomposed cow dung, dried leaves, and other biodegradable wastes collected from fields and kitchen. Distribute them evenly on the sand layer.\nContinue adding both the chopped bio-waste and partially decomposed cow dung layer-wise into the tank up to a depth of 0.5-1.0 ft.\nAfter adding all the bio-wastes, release the earthworm species over the mixture and cover the compost mixture with dry straw or gunny bags.\nSprinkle water regularly to maintain the moisture content of the compost.\nCover the tank with a thatch roof to prevent the entry of ants, lizards, mice, snakes, etc., and protect the compost from rainwater and direct sunshine.\n\n \n \nMixing of organic manure in the soil:\nBefore planting, mix some amount of manure in the soil to increase fertility status and nutrient availability in your soil. And the mixing of organic manure introduces millions of microorganisms into the soil and makes it alive. \n\nInorganic matter &amp; ideal soil: \nInorganic matter of soil refers to all the nutrients present in the soil. Ideal and healthy soil is the one that contains both organic matter and a good amount of nutrients with the proper proportion of soil air and soil water.  \n\n \nWhen you think of starting gardening or planting a sapling make sure your soil contains organic matter like biowaste and nutrients, with proper drainage level. Because soil is the basic thing that makes all the difference in the growth of plants. So always choose fertile and well-draining soil that supports your plant growth.\n \n \n \n                 ",

        "articleBody": "Vertical gardening is trending among urban dwellers who wish to create a lush garden in their tall rise homes. There are many advantages to having a vertical garden including creating a green cover that purifies the air and also attracts birds and butterflies. Vertical gardening is also popular among many who want to create a kitchen garden and grow their own fruits and vegetables. \n \nSteps to Setup the Vertical Garden\nHere we discuss how you can easily set up a vertical home for your plants and shrubs by following just 10 easy steps. \nStep 1: Select a Wall\nYou can choose a wall in your home that you want to cover up or beautify. This can be a balcony wall or one that receives enough sunlight. Make sure that the wall you select has all the suitable conditions required for proper plant growth. You can purchase specific plants that grow well in your selected spot. \n \nStep 2: Create the Frame\nThe wall setup of your vertical garden is usually a three-layer sandwich of the frame, plastic sheeting, and fabric. Experts suggest using a PVC pipe to build the basic structure of the frame. Plastic is considered to be a better option compared to metal or wood frames as they are susceptible to changes in the external environment and may rot when exposed to moisture. You can build the frame on the wall itself or you can create a frame that can be hanged on the wall. Many gardeners prefer the latter as this way they can easily remove and re-fix the frame as and when the need arises. \n \nStep 3: Attach a Plastic Sheet\nAfter you create the frame, you must attach a plastic sheet over it. This is a very important step as the plastic will act as a barrier between the fabric (the third layer) and the wall. As the fabric will have high moisture content, the plastic sheet will prevent water from creating fungus or mold on the wall. \n \n \nStep 4: Attach Two Layers of Fabric\nThe final layer you need to attach is the fabric that will hold the water required for your plants to grow. Experts suggest using felt carpet padding or other fabric materials that can retain water well and not rot easily.\nYou must use two layers of fabric to ensure durability and to create a pouch for your plants. The fabric must be stretched and then stapled onto the frame with stainless steel staples or galvanized screws. The fabric should not have any wrinkles or folds and must be stretched well till it is taut. \n \nStep 5: Add the Irrigation System\nThe irrigation system will provide the water necessary for your plants to grow. You can create a system using poly tubing and fittings that lock. The tube can be placed across the top of the frame and the water will drip through the emitters on the tube. If you are having trouble setting up the system, you can get a system from TrustBasket. Once the frame is set you can attach it to the wall using rust-proof hardware.\n \nStep 6: Add Fertilizer and Connect Irrigation System to Water Source\nFertilization is extremely important. You can attach a liquid fertilizer injector to the valve of the irrigation system. You can also use a water filter to keep the water free of dust and other particles that might create a block in the system. The irrigation system must then be connected to the water source. Water dripping to the ground is inevitable so you can place a few plant pots underneath your vertical garden setup. With a self-watering irrigation system, you can easily maintain your green wall and ensure it receives enough water even when you are away from home. \n \nStep 7: Attach the Pots or Pouches\nThere are specific pots that are available for vertical gardening setups. You can attach the pots one above the other in a vertical format until you have created the desired height for your green wall. There are different types and sizes of colorful plant pots available in the online plant store so you can easily choose a set of planters or pots that are right for your vertical garden. You can add PVC pipes along the length of the frame and hang the readily available vertical garden pots to the frame with ease. \n \nStep 8: Choose Your Plants\nBefore choosing the plants you need to consider the humidity, wind, sun, and the shade your vertical garden will be receiving. Selecting native plants that thrive in your weather condition will help to keep your garden green throughout the seasons. Some of the common plants preferred for vertical gardens in India are crotons, ferns, bromeliads, pothos, dracaena, and succulents. You can also grow fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, melons, peas or tomatoes, on the vertical garden. If you are creating a detachable green wall, then you can easily remove it during extreme summers and protect your plants by placing the frame in shade. \n \nStep 9: Place the Plants\nInstead of buying vertical planters, you can directly place the plants on the fabric layer itself by making a horizontal cut in the outer layer of the fabric and inserting the plant in the cut. You can create a pouch-like holding for the plant by attaching the fabric to the plastic layer using stainless steel staples. Soon, the plants will take over the frame and you will be left with a beautiful wall garden.\n \nStep 10: Maintenance\nVertical gardens are a boon for people with mobility issues as they can easily take care of the green wall without having to bend down to prune or water the plants. The space-saving installation makes it easy for anyone tending their garden to remove shedding foliage, manage any pest, refill fertilizer, test irrigation system, trim plants or refurbish the wall with seasonal plants. \n\nConclusion\nTo create a beautiful vertical garden place plants that grew 2 to 3 feet in height in the pots/slots arranged in the top part. You can place ferns and succulents in the slots below as this will provide the necessary shade for the plants to grow. A vertical garden is also a great conversation starter among friends and family and can be a peaceful spot at home.

        "articleBody": " When you have a keen observation of plants' growth, you will notify the difference in the growth of plants. Some plants will be growing really well and some will be really struggling to grow. This is mainly due to the difference in the growing media of plants.\n\nYes, the base soil will make all the difference. If the soil is healthy and fertile plant will be robust enough. If the soil used is not healthy and fertile, then your plants will get nothing from it to grow well. That's why understanding the soil is very important for any plant grower. Here we will explain what is healthy and living soil, what is organic soil, and how it helps your plant's growth in many ways.\n \nSoil is not a simple matter on the mother earth as it looks. It is a very complex thing formed on earth. The soil has billions of microorganisms. It took millions of years for nature to form a fertile soil that can support life on earth.\n\n \nIf you have a habit of trucking, you may notice that plants in the forest grow really well. You might be having a question that who will take care of these plants that grow so well. Even after providing all the necessary inputs for your plants at home. They will not grow so well as in their natural habitat.\n\nIf we look closely at how the natural ecosystem works in the forest. It is really fascinating how every living organism is interlinked.  So many animals from ants to elephants live together; they give their excreta, dead animals eventually buried in the soil. Plant leaves and branches fall off on the ground. All this waste matter will be converted by so many microorganisms and tiny insects present in the soil. All these creatures work effortlessly and finally convert the waste matter into what is called compost. This is nothing but organic matter.\n \n \nOrganic matter or compost is the main reason behind every plant's healthy growth in the forest. Soil present in the forest will have a good amount of organic matter. That's why plants in the forest thrive happily.\n \nImportant components of soil:\nSoil consists of four important components. They are organic matter, inorganic matter, and soil air and soil water.\n\nOrganic matter: partially decayed, partially decomposed plant, and the animal residue is called organic matter. \nLike human beings, even plants also want food and nutrition for growth and development.  Plants will obtain these nutrients through organic matter. When you mix organic matter in the soil, plants will be able to absorb the nutrients and establish well. That's why the first component of soil i.e. organic matter becomes very important.\n \nCriteria to select the fertile soil:\nThere are many criteria for choosing fertile soil. They are color, compactness, and smell.\n\n\n Color: fertile soils usually will have a dark color. Like dark red, dark grey, deep black. If you know this you can choose the right soil for your plants.\n\n\n     2.Compactness: soil containing organic matter will be compact enough to form a shape. When you try to break, it should break easily. If it makes a different shape when you try to break it, then it is too compact.\n\n     3.Smell: a healthy soil smells like earth, it will not be having an unpleasant odor. Odorless soil may not contain any organic matter.That's why when you try to collect some easily available soil; you need to have a check.\n \nDead soil into live soil:\nThere are many ways to convert dead soil or unfertile soil into live or fertile soil. The best way to do this is the bokashi composting.\nBokashi composting:\nYou can use your kitchen waste to prepare organic manure by the bokashi method. Here microorganisms work anaerobically to convert waste into manure. The main difference between the traditional method of composting and bokashi composting is that conversion of waste into manure is fast. It will be the noblest job if you prepare compost at your home.\n\nIf you cannot prepare compost at home, you can buy it from known sources. If you decided to buy manure online buy from a reputed brand. Have a look at what people are talking about the brand. Buy a small quantity and test it if you are satisfied you can buy again. Definitely adding compost to your soil will greatly help your plants to grow well.\n \nPreparation of organic manure:\nNaturally, organic manure is plants and animals waste. If we consider cow dung manure, or sheep, goat manure, those animals eat the grass, in their stomach, many enzymes will work on the digestion. Whatever excreta come out of it will be rich in many nutrients. When nature allows it to decompose for a few more days, it will add a good number of nutrients to the soil.\n\nArtificially manure or compost is prepared by letting the animal and plant waste to decompose for a few months, to reduce the higher concentration of nutrients, which may affect your plants if applied directly. So the decomposed and decayed animal residue will form the manure.\nIn the case of vermicomposting, cow dung and plant waste is fed to the earthworms. They will eat this waste, digest and give their excreta as the rich organic manure called vermicompost. Nutritionally vermicompost is far superior to other kinds of manures and supports plant growth and development.\n\nMixing compost with the dead soil:\nWhen you mix vermicompost or any other organic manure into the soil, essentially you have mixed millions of microorganisms into your soil. It makes the dead soil into the living soil.\n\nImportance of microorganisms for plants:\nWhen you apply manure to your soil, plants will not be able to absorb all the nutrients present in it. Because some nutrients will be in an unavailable form. Plants cannot easily absorb the unavailable form of nutrients and utilize it for their growth. Therefore microorganisms take an important role here to convert the unavailable form of nutrients into the available form of nutrients and help your plants to absorb the nutrients from the soil and to support the growth.\n \nAn example of such a microbe is phosphorus solubilizing bacteria. Which converts the unavailable form of phosphorus to the available form and helps the plant's grow.\nIf you mix some good organic manure into your soil, many microorganisms will work and convert unavailable nutrients to available form. Therefore it is very essential to check whether your soil is dead or alive before planting.\n \nWhen you have live soil many microorganisms work on your behalf and help your plants to grow well. That's why healthy, fertile, and alive soil is very important for any plant's growth and development. Always choose the right soil for your plant to succeed in gardening.Watch the below video where we explain the organic matter of soil in detail.\n",

While choosing pots be little creative. From old shoes to well-polished ceramic pots can be used as a container of the plant. But before using any pot as a container keep in mind some criteria, which makes your plant healthy and supports growth. \n\n \nConsider size, shape, color, weight, position, and material it is made of. More importantly, check the drainage hole in pots.\n1. Perfect size matters:select pot size in the correct proportion to your plant. Always not more than three fourth height of your plant suits best. If your plant loves wet conditions go for bigger sized pot. Because the outflow of water will be less. If plants grow well in dry conditions select small pots, water outflow will be more. Selecting smaller pots for bigger plants reduces plant growth and the plant will become root-bound. See your plant and select pots accordingly. (Different sized pots)\n\n \n2. Fit plant in the right shaped container:pots come in a variety of shapes. Plants having a long root system want taller and  cylindrical/ round pot Plants with short/ fibrous roots go well with rectangular pots. For kitchen herbs to use shallow rectangular pots, it gives more space for them to spread and grow           (Ex.Mint). \n  \n3.  Colour adds beauty to plants: color takes a very important role in the entire beauty of gardening. Use light-colored pots in sunny areas, because it reflects most of the solar radiation and keeps soil wet. Using dark-colored pots like black retains more heat which may damage young tender roots. According to the color of foliage choose contrast colored pots. Most of the time gold, white &amp; black polished pots go well with indoor plants. Using white-colored container add beauty to your plant and compliments your interior.               ( Coloured pots )\n\n4.

In the case of balcony use lightweight pots. For hanging purposes also use lightweight pots. If you frequently move your plant do not go for heavier pots &amp; made of concrete and stone. To keep on your tabletop use small, colorful pots with saucer. Otherwise, go for double potting. ( Table top planters)\n\n     5. Material made of:There are several kinds of pots made of plastic to metal. Depending on your convenience to use select pots accordingly. \n\n\n\nLightweight plastic pots: plastic pots are available in numerous colors. And are very handy to use because of its lightweight and cheap cost. Can be seen in various shapes also. And plastic pots hold water for a long time. But due to heat retention, it may damage your plant.( Plastic pots)\n\n\n\nEarthy terracotta Pots: Terracotta pots are good for plants because they are pours and allows the exchange of gases. Provide good drainage for plants. But soil becomes dry easily, you need to water plants frequently. And terracotta pots are fragile should be careful while handling. Their earthy look adds beauty to your garden.( Terracotta colour pots)\n\n\n\nAttractive wood containers: wooden pots are trendy, looks elegant, add nature to your plant. Use wooden pots which are made of cider tree, rosewood because they lost longer. Avoid treated wood pots as they may contain a chemical that is harmful to plants especially crop plants. While using wood containers to use a plastic liner for durability. You can prepare your Wood pots with some pieces of wood and nails.\n\n\n\nHeavy concrete/ stone pots: pots made of concrete/ stone are stronger, heavier can bear the weight of small trees and shrubs.

Double potting is to keep your plant in a practical pot with a drainage hole and then placing that pot with saucer in a metal ornamental container without a drainage hole. Most often metal pots rust after some time. Therefore use a plastic liner inside before planting.( Metallic pots )\n\n\n                      \n                                       In the present market container collection is not a limitation.

        "articleBody": "There is no better company than nature, especially after a long tired day. Bring it home with a home garden. Houseplants are a great accessory for interior spaces. For one, they are living entities that add texture, colour and warmth to your decor while infusing the home with fresh, clean air. They can serve as a focal point of a room or help soften the transition between spaces. \nRe-potting\nSo much about the functionality and purpose of houseplants! Let us get down to work and the very first step after getting your houseplants home is to re-pot them. Why? Because the plant from the nursery is likely to have already overgrown the pot it originally came in. If not properly re-potted in time, the plant is likely to have stunted growth or worse negative growth to continue to fit into its container. Another reason for re-potting is that it will give the plant fresh media to grow bigger and better.  \nSize of the pot\nThere are plenty of choices available in the category of garden pots online. But you need to choose a pot as per the size of your plant. If you go for a pot too big, then the soil dries slowly making the plant prone to root rot. A pot too small may cause the soil to dry out very quickly making the plant water challenging. A small pot will also make the plant root-bound resulting in stunted growth. The ideal size to re-pot in case of fast-growing plants is 2-4 inches bigger in diameter than the current size and for a slow-growing one it is 1-2 inches bigger.     \nMaterial of the pot\nGarden pots online are available in a variety of materials including terracotta, wood, ceramic, earthenware and plastic to name a few. Which one to choose? Go for materials that are both beautiful to look at as well as functional. Porous material is recommended as the better pot material choice because they dry evenly keeping the soil well aerated. But then they require you to water the plants more often. Terracotta, ceramic and earthenware are great choices for cacti, succulents, orchids and bromeliads. Wood pots dry even faster. \nIf weight is a consideration or you want the soil to retain moisture longer, then you may go for plastic flower pots online. Fiberglass pots and planters are also great options for bigger plants.    \nDrainage\nA drainage hole at the bottom of the pot drains the excess water out and lets air in. It allows the plant to thrive and brings down the chances of root rot. But a pot with drainage hole is not an inviting sight. We have a few methods for you to work around.\nOne, you can line the bottom of the pot with lava rocks or something similar. The lining creates crevices for excess water to drain into and away from the plant roots. Be quite generous with the number of rocks to prevent the risk of root rot as much as possible.\nSecondly, you can use the double potting technique by placing the pot with a drain hole into another pretty container called the cachepot. Just ensure that the cachepot is large enough to hold a saucer for the plant pot. Wicker baskets, glass bowls and metal boxes to cookie jars and enamelware, choose anything eye-catching or create your own cachepot.   \nPair the plants with the right garden pots online for their health and look.

        "articleBody": "Every plant requires an ideal environment for its growth. The garden pot in which you keep the plant plays a crucial role in its development. With so many different varieties available, it becomes essential to choose the right kind of pot for your plant. There are certain factors which you must be aware of while purchasing garden pots online to make sure that you get fruitful results.\n1. Material\nGarden pots can be of different types based on the material from which they are made. You should select the material according to the requirements of your plant. Various materials can be –\n\n\nTerra-Cotta: Terra-cotta pots are made up of porous clay, allowing the plants to breathe. With their earthy colour, they give a natural look to your garden. They maintain the temperature and moisture inside the soil and keep the plants healthy. However, they need to be handled with care due to their fragile nature.\n\nPlastic: Plastic pots offer excellent durability and are lightweight. They are ideal for plants that cover the whole pot when they grow. They help retain the moisture inside the soil. However, plastic pots of dark colour can be harmful to the plants due to the absorption of heat.\n\nConcrete: For large sized plants that need rigid support from the bottom, concrete pots can be the ideal thing. They offer excellent insulation and a comfortable environment for the plants to keep them protected from external damage. But they are difficult to handle due to their heavy weight.\n\nWood: Wooden pots are widely used because of their attractive look, practicality, and high water retention capability. But it is essential to make sure the wood used to make the pot is of good quality and resistant to rotting. You can paint them with non-toxic paints to prevent rotting. \n\n2. Size\nYou must consider the size up to which your plant can grow and the area in which you are going to keep the pot.\n\n\nSmall Pots: Small pots are ideal for small plants with low water requirements and shallow roots like cactus. A pot of small size may not be suitable for a large plant as it will keep the roots congested. It may resist the growth of the plant by cutting off the supply of essential nutrients, oxygen, and moisture.\n\nLarge Pots: large pots are ideal for plants which are larger in size and require more soil for their roots to grow. Having a plant with small roots in large pots cause the soil to get superfluous and act as a barrier to the growth of the plant. But it can retain water as it may take a lot of time to dry out completely.\n\n 3. Drainage\nYou need to make sure that the pot which you buy for your plant must allow proper drainage of water. It should contain drainage holes of the appropriate size to let the water pass so that the roots can get sufficient amount of oxygen. If the excess water is unable to drain from the pot, it may cause damage to the plant.\n4. Porosity\nIt is essential that the container must be porous. Pots made from a natural material like clay, timber, or terracotta provide better porosity and helps in the movement of air and moisture through the pot. It also helps in maintaining the temperature of the plant. Porous pots prevents rotting of the roots by keeping the soil cool and drawing the excessive water.\nTrust Basket offers a great variety of pots like hanging pots and balcony flower pots from which you can choose the one ideal for your plant. Make the right choice by considering the factors listed above and purchase the best pot from Trust Basket today. \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Fruits are one of the richest sources of nutrients. They contain almost all the nutrients required for a human. Fruits are capable of improving the immune system. Few fruits are rich in antioxidants. So doctors suggest eating sufficient quantity fruits regularly. In my previous blogs, I had mentioned about Fruits with the antioxidant property and Fruits that can improve the immune system. Here is one such fruit that is very rich in nutrients and good for health. It is Avocado or popularly known as Butter Fruit. Today, let us look into the details about Avocado Tree or Butter Fruit Tree.\nAbout Avocado or Butter Fruit\n\nImage sourceAvocados are one of the wonderful fruits grown in summer. They truly are one of the top superfoods to add to your diet. Avocados are a nutrient-dense fruit that contains about 20 vitamins and minerals. Avocados do not contain any cholesterol or sodium and are low in saturated fat. The yellow-green flesh inside the fruit is either scooped and eaten or made a milkshake. There are many types of avocado that vary in shape and color from pear-shaped to round and green to black. It’s often called \"alligator pear,\" which is very descriptive, as it tends to be pear-shaped and has green, bumpy skin like an alligator.\n \nAbout the Avocado Tree\nThe avocado tree is said to have originated in South Central Mexico. The fruit of the plant also called an or avocado pear or alligator pear is a large berry containing a single large seed known as a \"pit\" or a \"stone. It is easy to grow your own avocado tree from seed. Just follow the below steps to grow your own Avocado tree at home.\n\nImage source For growing Avocado at home, you can either get a plant from the nursery or grow them from the seeds. If you are willing to make it from the scratch, you need to take a healthy Avocado seed to germinate by removing the pulpy part on it. Be careful not to remove the brown skin on the pit, it is seed cover. Soak the seed in water. Some avocado pits are slightly elliptical, whereas others are shaped almost like perfect spheres. But all avocado pits have a flat ‘bottom’ from where the roots will grow and a sharp ‘top’ from which the sprout will grow. The slightly pointier end is the top, and the flat end is the bottom. In order to get your pit to sprout, you will need to place the bottom root end in water. Using toothpicks make sure the bottom is placed in water and the top part of the seed is in the air.\n\nImage sourceThe seeds will take minimum 8 weeks to germinate. The top of the avocado seed will start to dry out and form a crack once it is time for germination. The outer brown seed skin will be peeled off. The crack will extend to the bottom of the avocado seed and a tiny taproot will begin to emerge through the crack at the bottom. A small sprout can be seen peeking through the top of the avocado pit gradually. Once the plant reaches 4 to 5 inches in height, move them to the pot or directly to the ground. But make sure to provide a nutrient-rich potting mix for the plant so that you can get a healthy yield. Water the plant sufficiently but do not overwater. Overwatering may cause yellowing of leaves and the plants may perish.\n \nAvocado plants may start bearing fruits after they are 3 or 4 years old. Sometimes they may take more than 10 years to grow fruits. So you cannot expect every tree to bear fruits. It depends on the pollination criteria as well. Be patient about seeing fruit. If you have purchased and planted a tree, you can probably expect to see your first fruit three to four years after planting. If you are growing from a seed, it can take anywhere from five to 13 years before the tree is mature enough to set fruit.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "In my previous blogs, I have discussed about many kinds of plants. Each plant has a unique feature. For instance - Venus Flytrap is a Carnivorous plant, Sansevieria and Syngonium are Air Purifying plants etc., There are some plants which are believed to have mythological prominence. Some plants are related to ancient traditions. One such plant is Lucky Bamboo. It is a small house plant that is grown in a pot containing water. Today let us know about Lucky Bamboo.\nWhat is a Lucky Bamboo?\n\nImage source Lucky Bamboo is an indoor plant that is said to bring good luck according to Feng Shui. Dracaena sanderiana is the scientific name of Lucky Bamboo plant. It was named after the German–English gardener Henry Frederick Conrad Sander Lucky Bamboo plant is very easy to grow at home. This plant is one of the most popular feng shui cures. It is very easy to care Lucky Bamboo plant as it can survive in any kind of light. Feng shui principles claim that bamboo attracts auspicious energy. Since the bamboo plant is strong, it can energize your home. Keeping lucky bamboo inside houses and business place is believed to bring happiness and prosperity. The plant has become the most popular indoor plant in certain parts of India, where the plants are usually imported from China and Taiwan.\n \n\nImage sourceIt is said to be equivalent to the feng shui elements. The five elements in feng shui are Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal. The bamboo plant expresses the feng shui Wood element, the rocks that create the foundation of growth for the lucky bamboo represent the Earth element the water the bamboo needs for its growth represents the Water element. The feng shui lucky bamboo plants usually have a red ribbon tied to them which is the expression of the Fire element. The glass pots that most lucky bamboo plants come with represent the Metal element. If your feng shui lucky bamboo is planted in a ceramic pot or plastic pot, it will usually have either a metal coin (Chinese coins for good luck) or a metal figurine, such as the Laughing Buddha.\nHOW TO CARE LUCKY BAMBOO?\n\nLucky Bamboo plants are one of the easiest plants to take care of. Here are a few Important Instructions.\n1. Lucky Bamboo is an indoor plant. Keep it away from direct sunlight.2. Make sure the water level is above the roots of the plants. Keeping it above 1 inch is sufficient.3. Change the water once in 14 days to avoid rot from rotting and to prevent flies from laying eggs in the water.\nHere are the essential components to ensure a healthy and long-lasting Lucky Bamboo plant:\n\nLIGHT:\nLucky Bamboo will do best with moderate levels of indirect light. Do not expose the plant to direct sunlight, such as a sunny windowsill. The direct sunlight is too strong for the plant and causes the leaves to warp and the leaves will turn brown. Lucky Bamboo should always be kept indoors.\nWATER:\nWe highly recommend bottled water or filtered water. Tap water contains chlorine that will cause the tip of the leaves to turn brown. If you must use tap water, you can eliminate most of the chlorine and chemical by letting it sit 24 hours before adding it to the plant. To prevent the roots from drying, always keep the water level at least 1 inch high. Do not submerge the plants completely underneath the water. The top of the stalk must be exposed to air so that it can breathe properly. Change the water every 14 days to prevent the roots from rotting.\nReasons for leaves turning yellow\n1. High chlorine in the water.\nTry using bottled water or filtered water. If you cannot afford it, you can fill a container with tap water and let it settle for 24 hours. This will eliminate most of the chlorine from the water. \n2. Plant exposed to direct sunlight.\nMove your plants away from direct sunlight. Your plant does not require any light from the sun. It will be fine with the light source from you’re the light bulb and lamps.\nFeng Shui Tradition for Layers of Lucky Bamboo\n \nImage sourceAccording to Feng Shui, the number of Lucky Bamboo layers that are bound together is responsible for the positive effect.\n\n2 layer - represent love.3 layers - represent happiness, wealth and long life.5 layers - represent 5 types of wealth in life which are spiritual, mental, emotional, physical, and intuitive.6 layers - represent good luck and wealth.7 layers - represent good health.8 layers - represent growth.9 layers - represent great luck.10 layers - represent perfection.21 layers - represent a powerful blessing.\n \n\nIt makes an ideal gift for household, office, new ventures, or parties.

You can grow most dracaenas in regular household conditions as they tolerate low light, but can also grow in medium and bright spots too. Water dracaenas when the soil surface gets dry or once a week. It can vary depending on the size of your plant, the size of its pot, the amount of light it gets and other factors. Most dracaenas really don't require much fertilizer. You can add fertilizers once or twice in a year to maintain your Dracaena plants which would be more than enough. \n4.

        "articleBody": "Do you like chocolates? There is nobody on this earth who doesn't like chocolates. Everybody gets excited by just hearing the word \"Chocolate\". It is such a magical word. Irrespective of age groups, everybody loves to eat chocolate. A piece of chocolate is enough to bring happiness on your dear one's face. But do you know how are chocolates manufactured? I was excited to know about the process and collected some information. Some of you might be aware that chocolates are manufactured from the Cocoa beans of the Cocoa tree. The beans are processed and the chocolates are made. Today I'm discussing about the Cocoa Tree or Chocolate Tree.\nWhat is a Cocoa Tree?\n\nImage sourceCocoa Tree or scientifically called Theobroma cacao is a small evergreen tree native to the deep tropical regions of the Americas. The seeds also called cocoa beans are used to make cocoa mass, cocoa powder, bakery products, ganache and chocolate.Chocolate originally found in South America is known as “The Food of the Gods.” The first record of chocolate or cocoa dates back to 1900 BC. The people used chocolate seeds as a form of currency. Chocolate was served as a bitter beverage in the early days and was believed to be having super powers. \nWhat are Cocoa Beans or Cocoa Seeds?\n\nImage source\n\nImage sourceCocoa beans or Cocoa seeds are the dried and fully fermented seeds of Theobroma cacao tree from which cocoa solids and cocoa butter can be extracted. These beans are roasted, powdered and used as the main ingredient in the preparation of chocolate.\nGrowing condition for Cocoa Trees\n\nImage sourceThe chocolate tree is a small tree and grows as an understory species in the rainforest. So it can tolerate partial sun conditions. Most standard potting mixes are fine for the chocolate plant. It needs good drainage with a pH of 5 to 6. The chocolate tree is easy to grow in pots but it needs a bit of room to produce fruit. Cocoa Plants are generally grown from seed and need 3-4 years to reach fruiting size. The tree reaches 5 to 6 feet in height with a trunk diameter of 1.5 to 2 feet. A large, sunny and warm spot is needed to grow a Cocoa tree. A Cocoa plant requires a warm growing area with the temperature above 15°c. The flowers are produced on the woody trunks and branches in clusters.\n \n\nImage sourceFruits are produced once the tree has reached 5 to 6 feet in height. Initially, the potted plant will produce 3-4 chocolate pods. The fruit develops as a small green pod and grows for many months until it is fully matured. Matured fruit will be 4 to 8 inches long. It turns from green to a yellow or yellow-orange color once the fruits ripen. The ripening process takes 5-6 months. After this, it is ready to pick. Cocoa harvest is not restricted to one period per year and a harvest typically occurs over several months.\n \n\nImage sourceCocoa can be harvested at any time of the year. Unlike most fruiting trees, the cacao pod grows directly from the trunk or large branch of a tree rather than from the end of a branch, similar to jackfruit. This makes harvesting by hand easier as most of the pods will not be up in the higher branches. \nHow are Cocoa beans processed?\n\nImage sourceThe harvested Cocoa Pods are opened using a sharp tool and the Cocoa beans with the pulp are extracted. The beans are spread on the floor and dried for a few days. During this time the seeds and pulp undergo \"sweating\", where the thick pulp liquefies. The fermented pulp flows away leaving cocoa seeds behind. Sweating is an important stage for the quality of the beans, which gives a strong and bitter taste. If sweating is interrupted, the resulting cocoa may lose its characteristic flavor and the whole process will be spoiled.\n \n\nImage sourceEach pod contains nearly 30 to 40 beans in it. About 800 dried beans are required to make 1kg of chocolate. The beans are roasted in a big container. The resulting pieces of beans are called nibs. Since nibs are directly from the cocoa tree, they contain high amounts of theobromine. \nImage source\nThe nibs are crushed using various methods and made into a thick, creamy paste, known as chocolate liquor or cocoa paste. This \"liquor\" is then further processed into chocolate by mixing in cocoa butter and sugar. Alternatively, it can be separated into cocoa powder and cocoa butter using a Hydraulic press or the Broma process.\n \n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nThe mixture of cocoa paste, cocoa butter and sugar is given the desired shape and packed. This is how delicious chocolates are made in factories.\nVarieties of Cocoa Tree\nThe three main varieties of the cocoa plant are Forastero, Criollo, and Trinitario. The Forastero is the most widely used variety comprising 80 to 90% of the world production of cocoa. Cocoa beans of the Criollo variety are rarer and considered a delicacy. Trinitario which is widely grown in Trinidad is a hybrid between Criollo and Forastero varieties. It is considered to be of much higher quality than Forastero as it gives a higher yield and is more resistant to disease.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Nature is a priceless gift in this world. There is no substitute for its beauty and grace. It includes plants, trees, river, hillocks and many more. When it comes to plants there are a vast variety of plants. In my earlier blogs, I had discussed about Carnivorous plants, Parasites, Poisonous plants, Unique Flowering plants with an unusual appearance etc., Flowers are one amazing part of nature which enhances the elegance and beauty of nature. Today let us look into some Flowering plants which have the ability to beautify your garden. \n1. Clarkia:\n\n\na. Plant category: Flower.b. Germination time: 7 to 10 days.c. The temperature required: 12 °C to 21°C.d. Harvest time: 80 to 120 days from germination.\n\nClarkias are annual flowering plants native to western North America and South America. Clarkia gets their name from a discoverer named William Clark. Clark discovered the plant on the Pacific Coast of North America and brought back specimens when he returned to his place. Clarkia is a winter season crop. It requires 12°C to 21°C. In this temperature, we can expect the better result. Clarkia requires good sunlight, so better to grow in outdoor. If you like to grow indoor place it where it can get good sunlight. Clarkia seeds will take 7 to 10 days to germinate from seeding. During the germination period, soil should be moist, so keep watering it frequently.You can either germinate the seeds in a seedling tray and then transplant it to the soil or directly sow the seeds in the soil. You can grow them either in pots or directly in the ground. It is better to use a nutrient-rich potting mix instead of using normal soil. Use organic plant food and Fertilizers to provide required nutrients to the plants instead of chemical fertilizers. Powdery mildew and Bacterial leaf spot are the common diseases that affect clarkia. If your plant is affected by these diseases, treat them early with Neem oil which protects the plant and acts as an organic pesticide.\nWatering Tips\n\nImage source\nDaily watering in summer, two days once in the winter season and 3 days once in rainy season if rainwater does not flow to the plant is the ideal way to water Clarkia plants.\nHarvesting\n\nImage sourceClarkia will take 80 to 120 days to harvest from the seeding. Once the flowers start to open and bloom perpendicularly to the stalk, you can harvest them. You can pluck the Clarkia flowers directly from hand. But handle the plant gently while doing so. You can also cut the flowers from pruning secateurs safely, it will grow again.\n2. Verbena\n\n\na. Plant category: Flower.b. Germination time: 20 to 25 days.c. The temperature required: 20 °C to 28°C.d. Harvest time: 80 to 100 days from germination.\n\nVerbena is a purple colored small flower with five petals in each flower. It is a flower native to Asia and America. It can be easily grown at home using the seeds. Summer season is the best season to grow Verbena. The germination process will be good in this season. It requires a minimum of 20°C to 28°C to grow well. In this temperature, the plant gives a good yield. Verbena seeds will take 20 to 25 days to germinate from the seeds. During the germination period, soil should be moist, so keep watering it frequently. As Verbena is a summer season crop, it requires good sunlight for at least 5 to 6 hours. So it is better to grow in outdoor. If you are planning to grow indoor place it where it can get sufficient sunlight.You can either sow the seeds in pots or directly sow in the ground. I suggest germinating them in a seedling tray and later transplant them to the pots or ground once they reach 2 to 3 inches in height. As soil plays a very important role in the growth of the plants, it is better suggested to use good potting soil that contains all the required nutrients. Use chemical free fertilizer to get a healthy yield. Blight, Powdery Mildew and Root Rot are the common diseases that affect Verbena. So use Neem oil which protects the plant and acts as an organic pesticide.\nWatering Tips\n\nImage sourceAs Verbena is a summer season crop, it does not require much watering. Watering once in 2 to 3 days during summer, once in 4 days during winter and the rainy season would be enough. \nHarvesting\nImage source\nVerbena flowers start to bloom after 80 to 100 days of germination provided it depends on the factors like water, sunlight and type of soil. Some varieties have stems long enough for cutting. As flowers fade, snip them off with scissors to keep the plants looking neat. You can pluck the Verbena flowers directly from hand. But handle the plant gently while doing so. You can also cut the flowers from pruning secateurs safely, it will grow again. \n\n3. Phlox\n\n\na. Plant category: Flower.b. Germination time: 10 to 20 days.c. The temperature required: 20 °C to 25°C.d. Harvest time: 100 to 120 days from germination.\n\nPhlox are perennials and one of the beautiful flower among wildflowers. These plants produce star-shaped, colorful flowers when in bloom. They are found mostly in North America in diverse habitats from alpine tundra to open woodland and prairie. Flowers are in pale blue, violet, pink, bright red, or white. They have a pleasant fragrant that attracts hummingbirds, and butterflies. Summer is the best season to grow Phlox. Phlox needs a minimum of 20°C to 25°C to grow well. In this temperature, we can expect the better result. Phlox seeds will take 10 to 20 days to germinate from seeding. As Phlox is a summer season crop, it can withstand high sunlight. It can also sustain less sunlight. But I suggest to keep it outdoors in the sunlight for better growth. You can easily grow Phlox at home with seeds. They can grow both in pots and seeds. As they are summer season crop, they do not prefer moist soil. So use a relevant potting soil that helps the plant to grow well. Using a chemical-free fertilizer not only helps in getting a good yield but also keeps the soil in a healthy condition. Nematodes can be a problem for Phlox. Treat early with insecticides specific to the nematode. You can also treat the plants Neem oil which protects the plant and acts as an organic pesticide.\nWatering Tips\n\nImage sourceWater the plants once in 2 days during Summer,  3 to 4 days once in winter and rainy season if the soil is dry. You can use the Drip Irrigation technique to water your plants efficiently with minimal effort.\nHarvesting\n\nImage sourcePhlox flowers will take 100 to 120 days to bloom and ready for harvest from the seeding.

        "articleBody": "Plants take a major part on this earth. Most of the living creatures directly or indirectly depend on the plants for their survival. There are different kinds of plants on this earth. In my previous blogs, I had mentioned about Ancient Indian Plants with Scientific reasons, Carnivorous plants, Plants that are hard to kill, Medicinal plants, Poisonous plants, Parasites, Succulents, Astrological plants and Air purifying plants. Today, the blog is about Mosquito Repellent plants. Most of the diseases today are spread by the mosquitoes. Generally, we use chemical repellents to protect ourselves from mosquitoes and other flies. Those chemicals are not only dangerous to them but also to us. Using such chemical repellents is not preferred as it can cause health hazards. We need to think for an organic substitute for it. So here are some of the Mosquito Repellent plants. These are 100% natural and non-hazardous. \n1. Marigold plant:\n\nImage sourceMarigold is one of the commonly used flowers in India. It is widely used for decoration purpose as well as for religious worshipping. Its attractive colors make the flower look unique. Marigold plant is one of the easiest flower plants to grow at home. But did you know that Marigold plant is a Mosquito repellent plant? Yes, its characteristic smell makes the plant Mosquito repellent. It emits a smell that repels mosquitoes. You can grow them in pots and place them near your patio or entrance to keep the bugs out. Marigolds are also a popular addition to borders and vegetable gardens. According to research, marigold plants not only keep away mosquitoes, but they also prevent aphids, thrips, whiteflies, Mexican bean beetles, squash bugs, and tomato hornworms attacking the plants.\n2. Holy Basil or Tulsi:\n\nImage sourceTulsi plant or holy basil is considered to be one of the sacred plants in India. Our ancestors worshipped it as a god and have made it mandatory for every household. Tulsi has been given a great importance in Ayurveda. The reason why our ancestors have made it mandatory to grow tulsi is that of its medicinal qualities. It is scientifically proven that tulsi plant produces oxygen even in the night time. It also purifies the air around. Its characteristic aroma is enough to cure many diseases. It also stimulates the sense of smell which is essential for a person to keep healthy. It is not only used for medicine, the tulsi plant can also prevent mosquitoes and other insects from entering the house. The pungent smell the basil leaves produce keeps the pests away. So Tulsi plant or holy basil was suggested to grow at every house by our ancestors. \n3. Lavender:\n\nImage sourceLavender is one amazing flowering plant with a very pleasant fragrance. Even though lavender's fragrance is often enjoyed by humans, lavender repels mosquitoes because mosquitoes dislike the scent lavender gives off. It can be planted in gardens or made into oil and applied to the skin or mixed with other oils to keep mosquitoes away. You can use the lavender oil as a natural repellent. To stay safe from mosquitoes, you can directly apply the oil to the ankles, wrist, or feet. The mode of application is similar to that of a perfume. Unlike some oils that are used to ward off insects, lavender oil isn't burned in candle form or sprayed as an aerosol. While it is possible to distribute the oil this way, the best results come when the plant's oil is applied topically to the skin. \n4. Rosemary:\n\nImage sourceRosemary is a perennial evergreen shrub with blue flowers. It is an aromatic and distinctive herb with a sweet, resinous flavor. It belongs to the mint family \"Lamiaceae\" which includes many other fragrant herbs. The name \"rosemary\" is a Latin word where \"ros\" means Dew and \"marinus\" means Sea. It is also called \"Dew of the Sea\". It is native to the Mediterranean and Asia but grows in cool climates. It can withstand droughts, surviving a severe lack of water for lengthy periods. The rosemary plant is effective in several forms on its own as a mosquito repellent. Known for its flavor, it is also used for many culinary purposes. Its flowers have a characteristic flavor that repels mosquitoes. It is suitable for growth in a garden bed but it can also grow indoors if it gets full sun. The live plant, cuttings from the plant and rosemary essential oil are all effective at repelling mosquitoes. They can also be used for the decorative purpose by shaping them and pruning according to the requirement. While the pests stay away you can enjoy the herb’s fragrance and also use it to make your cooking delicious.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

In the previous blog, I had discussed briefly about different Composting methods. Today let me explain you about one of the effective methods called Vermicomposting.\nWhat is Vermicomposting?\n\nImage sourceThe process of cultivating earthworms in order to convert organic waste into fertilizer is called Vermicomposting or Vermiculture. This process is done using various species of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms, and other earthworms, to create a mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste.\nWhat are Earthworms?\n\nImage sourceEarthworms are called as farmer's friend. It is a very useful creature for gardeners. It helps in making the soil fertile. It feeds on the debris, manure, rotten plant parts etc and ferments it. The worms feed on the organic waste and produce nutrient-rich manure in the form of excreta. The excreta of earthworms are nutritious and hence the soil becomes fertile. They move throughout the soil and loosen the soil. This will allow air circulation to happen inside the soil and the roots get enough space to grow and extend. The converted end product or manure is called Vermicompost. This compost will be rich in Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium compared to other composts. Vermicompost contains water-soluble nutrients and is an excellent, nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner. It is used in farming and small-scale organic farming. \nCommon doubts that arise in Vermicomposting process\nThere are come common doubts that comes to your mind before starting the vermicomposting process. Here are few of them.\n \n1. Components required for Vermiculture:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nThe essential components of a home vermiculture unit are an aerated container, moist bedding, food waste or debris and earthworms worms. You can purchase the DIY Vermicompost which contains live worms and start the process. The worms feed on the food waste or debris and convert them into manure. The container must contain holes so that the excess water can flow out by not harming the process. The most common materials used for the container are recycled plastic and wood. Vermicompost bins made from plastic are ideal but require more drainage holes than wooden containers as they are non-absorbent. Wooden bins will gradually decay, so they need to be replaced often.\n2. Climatic conditions to carry out the Vermiculture process:\n\nImage sourceThe most common worms used in composting systems are redworms (Eisenia foetida, Eisenia Andrei, and Lumbricus rubellus). They feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15–25 °C and can survive at 10 °C. Temperatures above 30 °C may harm these worms. So it is important to maintain the favorable temperature. Other worms like Perionyx excavatus are suitable for warmer climates. If you are planning to keep the worm bin outside, you need to avoid direct sunlight and must be insulated against frost in winter. \n3. What all can be converted in the Vermicomposting method?\nAlmost all the decomposable food waste can be converted by the worms including raw vegetables, peels, fruits and other food residues. There are few food wastes that vermicomposting cannot compost which includes meat waste and dairy products. Earthworms cannot digest the meat and dairy products. So you cannot compost them in this process.\nHarvesting the compost\n\nImage sourceThe pyramid method of harvesting vermicompost is a commonly used method in vermiculture. It is considered the simplest method for single layer bins. In this process, the compost is separated into large clumps which are placed back into composting for additional conversion. The process continues with lighter compost. This lighter mix is placed into small piles in the bin. The worms spontaneously burrow to the bottom of the pile. After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This process repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.\nOverview:\n\nImage sourceEvery process has some advantages as well as disadvantages. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages.\n\nAdvantages:\n\na. It consumes less space. So it is easy to use in urban homes.b. It does not require any special types of equipment. You can utilize the containers available in your household.c. You can harvest the compost from the bin and utilize it to the potted plants.d. It is 100% organic process as we are using earthworms for the conversion.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\na. Earthworms cannot digest the meat. So you cannot compost meat in this process.\nb. As the process takes place in open space, there are chances of mosquitoes and other flies surrounding the container and creates inconvenient atmosphere.\n\n \nIn spite of having few drawbacks, Vermiculture is an effective process to obtain compost in an organic way.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Food is the basic need of any living being. It helps our body by providing the required nutrients for carrying out the metabolism. Even though food provides all the nutrients required for our body, it will be in our hand to choose the correct one depending on our body condition. For instance, if a person has diabetes, he needs to control the blood sugar. So he needs to avoid certain foods which are high in glucose. In India, more than 70% of the people are suffering from diabetes. It may look like a minor issue in the beginning but gets worse in the later stages. It can also turn into a deadly disease. Here are some of the vegetables that can help you out in maintaining your blood sugar level. It does not apply to only diabetes patients, even a normal person needs to follow this to avoid further health risks.\n1. Bitter Gourd or Karela:\n\nImage sourceBitter Gourd is one vegetable that is hated by most of the people due to its bitter taste. But it is very useful in managing the blood sugar level. It is a medicinal vegetable that is native to Asia, Africa and parts of the Caribbean. It has a very long history of use in Ayurvedic medicine. Studies say that medicinal uses of bitter gourds originated in India and then it was introduced into Traditional Chinese Medicine practices around the 14th century. Research shows that the Its juice, fruit and dried powder can all be used as a substitute for insulin and can be treated for diabetes. It is very useful in managing blood sugar levels and diabetes.\n \n \nImage sourceBitter Gourd is used primarily as an alternative therapy for lowering blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Considerably it is the most potent and popular vegetable in terms of managing diabetes through alternative medicine. Bitter Gourd contains polypeptide-P which have structural compositions similar to the animal insulin. The overall phytochemical composition of the bitter melon consists of charantin, steroidal saponins, and alkaloids. Charantin specifically augments glycogen synthesis within liver and muscle cells. All these compounds greatly contribute to the hypoglycemic effects of Bitter Gourd.How to Grow: https://www.trustbasket.com/blogs/how-to-grow/3-vegetables-that-can-be-grown-in-monsoon\n2. Fenugreek or Methi:\n\nImage sourceMethi or Fenugreek is a green vegetable that contributes to managing the blood sugar. Fenugreek seeds are helpful to people with diabetes. The seeds contain fiber and other chemicals which helps the body’s absorption of carbohydrates and sugar. The seeds also help to increases the amount of insulin release in the body. Fenugreek also benefits those with heart conditions such as hardening of the arteries and high blood levels of certain fats including cholesterol and triglycerides. It also shows potential for helping those who are diabetic. Many studies focus on the seed’s ability to lower blood sugar in people with diabetes.\n \n\nImage source A study has proved that if people with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus consumes 2.5 grams of fenugreek twice daily for three months, it significantly lowered cholesterol naturally along with triglycerides without affecting High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Eating baked food such as bread made with fenugreek flour also reduce insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes.

Beans:\n\nImage sourceLegume vegetables like Beans, Peas and Lentils are top sources of fiber. They also provide a good amount of protein which promotes blood sugar control and makes them a nutritious alternative to inflammatory proteins. As these foods do not increase inflammation in your body, they decrease the risk for diabetes and heart disease. One cup of cooked beans provides 18 grams of protein and over 10 grams of fiber. Beans are better suggested for diabetes. The American Diabetes Association advises people with diabetes to include beans in their meals every week. They are low on the glycemic index and can help manage blood sugar levels better than many other starchy foods.\n \n\nImage source 1/3 cup of cooked beans is equivalent to one starch diabetic exchange. One diabetic exchange of beans provides about 80 calories and about 15 grams of carbohydrates. Proper fiber consumption is very important in the prevention of diseases including diabetes. Beans are recommended as a regular part of a healthy diet to avoid several chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes and cancer.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Fruits play a very important role in maintaining one's health. Fruits serve as the main source of vitamins and minerals for our body. They contain the required vital nutrients that keep our body fit and healthy. By eating fruits everyday, we gain the necessary nutrients. For the same reason, our daily food habit includes these vegetables in it. Now one thing is clear that we will be healthy if we consume these fruits everyday. Feeding our body with certain foods may help keep our immune system strong. If you're looking for ways to prevent winter colds and the flu, here are some of the fruits that can help you out in maintaining our immune system. \n1. Papaya:\n\nImage sourcePapaya is one of the common fruit that is available almost in all the seasons. The greenish yellow fruit with orange pulp and black colored pepper like seeds are the unique identities of this fruit. Papaya contains a special digestive enzyme called papain, which helps in the process of digestion. It can also help the body to heal wounds, to reduce inflammation, to purify the blood, and much more. Papaya is also high in multiple vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and antioxidants and is used to boost overall health in numerous ways. So, it can be included in the list as part of a healing diet. Eating papaya can help to prevent constipation as it is a high fiber content. Papain can be found as a supplement alone and is found in many digestive enzyme formulations. Papayas have decent amounts of potassium, B vitamins, and folate, all of which are beneficial to our overall health.\n2. Apple:\n\nImage sourceAs an old Proverb says \" An apple a day, keeps the doctor away\", Apple can prevent many health-related problems. The nutrition benefits of Apple include the ability to improve our digestion, improve heart health and help you better manage our weight. Since many phytonutrients are present in apple pulp and skin, studies have proved the consumption of apples with a reduced risk of certain forms of cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, Alzheimer’s disease and even diabetes. One apple supplies about 14 percent of our daily vitamin C, which is considered a powerful antioxidant that’s important for skin, eye, immune and brain health. Like other antioxidants we obtain through fresh vegetables and fruits, vitamin C fights free radical damage and helps protect DNA and cells from mutation and malformation. \n3. Watermelon:\n\nImage sourceWatermelon is good immunity boosting fruit. An average sized watermelon has 270 mg of potassium, 30% of the daily value of vitamin A, and 25% of the value of vitamin C. Watermelon also provides vitamin B6 and glutathione. The body needs these vitamins, nutrients, and compounds like glutathione for proper immune function. Research has proved that watermelon improves the immune system by defending against the cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that watermelon is a rich source of citrulline, a certain type of amino acid that is metabolized to turn into arginine, an essential amino acid in the body. Arginine is used in the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is important for maintaining an effective immune system. Watermelon is a healing food because of its ability to protect the body from sickness and improve the digestive system where much of the immune system is located.\n4. Orange:\n\nImage sourceOranges are one of the best sources of vitamin C. It contains almost 99% of the total vitamin C needed for the whole day in just one serving. In addition to its powerful antioxidant properties, vitamin C also has the ability to improve immune function. Orange juice also serves as a source of vitamin A, an important nutrient required for improving immune function. Vitamin A promotes the development of new white blood cells, the immune cells that circulate in our bloodstream to identify and destroy harmful pathogens. It also helps activate our white blood cells so they can fight against the infections. It contains folate or vitamin B-9 which promotes healthy immune function. Folate helps in the healthy cell growth and also our cells to produce the DNA and protein or newly created cells. This is important for immune function as our body constantly produces new white blood cells to maintain our immune system. \n5. Kiwi Fruit:\n\nImage source Kiwis contain many nutrients and full of vitamin C. In fact, just 1 cup of kiwi provides about 273 percent of your daily recommended value. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient when it comes to boosting your immune system and to prevent the diseases. Kiwi contains a significant amount of fiber and antioxidants. One of the most important characteristics of kiwi fruit is it can protect your DNA from damage caused by reactive oxygen species, which form as a result of certain biochemical processes. It also contains nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin E, folate, and potassium. It is suggested to eat Kiwi Fruit for the patient recovering from dengue so as to regain their immunity at the earliest.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "The environment plays a very important role in the overall development of a human being. The atmosphere around us will be responsible for our health. Maintaining a good environment around us is very important. The word nature gives us a relaxed feeling irrespective of any sort of tensions. A whole lot of greenery comes into our mind when we think about nature. This greenery symbolizes peacefulness. In the ancient times, people lived in the forest where they use to nurture different kind of plants around their place. They were worshiping nature as God. They were spending their time growing different kinds of plants. Living in an atmosphere which has greenery gives pleasure to the body as well as to the soul. But today, we come across many instances where the trees are cut for human convenience. Trees are cut to broaden the road, to accommodate metro construction and other selfish reasons. This is not the issue of today. The environment is facing this issue since many years. Many environmental activists have tried their best and are still trying to protect the environment. Here is one such major movement which took place in India for the conservation of Trees and Environment.\n1. Chipko Movement:\n\nImage source The Chipko movement or Chipko Andolan was a forest conservation movement started in the year 1973 in Uttar Pradesh now in Uttarakhand by an environmental activist Sundarlal Bahuguna. This was an environmental movement where people hugged the trees to prevent them from being cut. This movement was inspired by an early revolution called Bishnoi movement that took place in 1730 AD in Khejarli, Marwar region in Rajasthan when 363 Bishnoi villagers led by a female villager called Amrita Devi sacrificed their lives to save sacred trees from being cut down by the king’s soldiers for a new palace.\n \nThe Bishnoi Movement\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nThis inspired movement became a rallying point for many future environmental movements all over the world. It created a sensation for nonviolent protest in India. Its movement inspired many eco-groups and helped to slow down the rapid deforestation, increased ecological awareness and demonstrated the viability of people power. This movement followed the method of satyagraha where both male and female activists from Uttarakhand played vital roles. Some of the activists who joined their hands with Sundarlal Bahuguna were Gaura Devi, Suraksha Devi, Sudesha Devi, Bachni Devi and Chandi Prasad Bhatt.\n \nThe leaders of Chipko Movement \n\nImage sourceIn the year 1987, the Chipko movement was awarded the \"Right Livelihood Award\" by the government of India. The struggle soon spread across many parts of the region. This spontaneous stand-offs between the local community and timber merchants occurred at several locations, with the local people demonstrating their new-found power as non-violent activists. As the movement gathered shape under its leaders, the name Chipko movement was given to their activities. According to Chipko historians, the term originally used was the word \"angalwaltha\" in the Garhwali language for \"embrace\", which later was adapted to the Hindi word, Chipko, which means to stick. Over the next five years, the movement spread to many districts in the region, and within a decade throughout the Uttarakhand Himalayas. Over time, as a United Nations Environment Programme report mentioned, Chipko activists started \"working a socio-economic revolution by winning control of their forest resources from the hands of a distant bureaucracy which is only concerned with the selling of forestland for making urban-oriented products\". The Chipko movement became a benchmark for socio-ecological movements in other forest areas. This movement is still doing its job until today. But unfortunately, it is not getting the required support for the respectful authorities.\n\nImage sourceThere has been many movements which were inspired by the Chipko movement and have contributed towards the conservation of environment. One such movement was Appiko Chaluvali in Karnataka.\n \nAppiko chaluvali:\n\nImage sourceAppiko Chaluvali or Appiko Movement is an inspirational movement from Sundarlal Bahuguna's Chipko Movement. In Kannada \"Appiko\" means \"to embrace\" or \"Hug\". This movement started in Gubbi Gadde, a small village near Sirsi in the North Karnataka (Uttara Kannada) district. This movement has forced the forest department to change the forest policy on deforestation. Besides affecting the forest policy, it also spread to other parts and saved forests. On 8th September 1983, this movement was started by an environmental activist named Pandurang Hegde. He was inspired by Sunderlal Bahugana's Chipko movement in Uttar Pradesh, in which villagers used to hug trees to save them from being cut by the State. Appiko movement started against monoculture practice i. e the agricultural practice of producing or growing one single crop over a wide area in the western ghats. Today, it has become a part of the lives of people. This non-violent protest has made the forest department to bring out the policy against deforestation in the eco-sensitive region. There has been a silent revolution in the Western Ghats from this Appiko Chaluvali. Started in Sirsi, the Appiko movement spread across the Western Ghats, including in places outside Karnataka. By linking up, campaigners managed to build awareness to conserve the sensitive environment in this region. Appiko is seen by some as a kind of echo of the more prominent Chipko movement of north India. The western Ghat biodiversity includes 120,000 living species, 4,500 flowering plants, 500 species of birds, 120 species of mammals, 160 species of reptiles, 70 species of frogs, 800 species of fish and 1493 species of medicinal plants.\n \nEven though Appiko chaluvali was not so effective compared to Chipko movement, it gave its honest contribution towards the environment.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Air is a very important component required for a living being to survive. Most of the living things depend on air for their biochemical reactions. Air can be abbreviated as Absolutely Important Resource. It comprises 78% of Nitrogen, 21% of Oxygen and 1% of other gases in the atmosphere. It is the main source for plants to perform photosynthesis by carbon-di-oxide and the main source for animals and human beings to breath oxygen. But after the invention of fueled vehicles, the amount of pollutants in the atmosphere is increasing. This is making the atmospheric air impure and polluted. In order to obtain pure air, we need to stop using the polluting vehicles which is a quite difficult job. But there is another way to obtain pure air, it is by growing air purifying plants. Yes, you read it right. There are some plants which are capable of purifying the atmospheric air. Here are some of the air purifying plants. These plants are certified as air purifying plants by NASA.\n \n1. Spider Plant or Chlorophytum comosum\n\nImage source\nChlorophytum comosum commonly called as Spider plant is one such plant that can purify the air. It is the best choice to grow for beginners. This plant usually grows and develop the leaf just like spiders, hence it is called as a spider plant.  It belongs to the tropical and southern Africa but has been spread to other parts of the world, including Western Australia and Asia. They will tolerate temperatures upto to 2 °C but grow best at temperatures between 18 °C to 32 °C. This plant has the ability to remove two poisonous gases namely Formaldehyde and Xylene. The NASA has proved that it removes around 90%  formaldehyde from the air which is a cancer-causing chemical. Since formaldehyde is found in common household products like adhesives, grout and fillers, you can grow these plants near your kitchen and bathrooms.\n \n2. Rubber Plant or Ficus robusta\n\nImage sourceRubber plant or Ficus robusta is one of the easiest houseplants to grow. As it does not require much attention and care, it can be grown easily by those with little experience with plants. Rubber plant can tolerate under-watering than over-watering. It is a species of plant native to East India, Nepal, Bhutan, Burma, China, Malaysia and Indonesia. It has spread wide to Sri Lanka, the West Indies etc., They improve indoor air quality by purifying the air according to studies conducted by NASA. Their large leaves are capable of absorbing airborne chemicals and makes them harmless. They absorb exhaled carbon dioxide and convert it to breathable oxygen. Rubber plants also eliminate bacteria and mold spores in the air. \n3. Syngonium\nSyngonium is one of the best indoor plants to grow. This plant is native to tropical rain forests in southern Mexico, West Indies, Central and Southern America. It is a cute little plant which can be easily grown indoors. Syngonium plants are not just a decorative plant, but also has the ability to cleanse the air around it and act as anti-pollutants. These plants can reduce components of indoor air pollution such as benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, and xylene. They also reduce airborne microbes and increase humidity. Researchers from NASA and have approved this plant as an air purifier. Syngoniums absorb pollutants into their leaves and the toxins go to the root zone where they are transformed into nutrients for the plant. This plant produces water vapors that absorb polluted air to the roots where the plant converts the toxins to plant food.\n4. Sansevieria or Mother-in-Law's Tongue\n\nSansevieria or Snake plant is one of the best indoor plants to grow. It belongs to the succulents category native to Africa, Madagascar and Southern Asia. This succulent plant is also known as devil's tongue plant or Mother-in-law's tongue plant. Snake plant would be the highest rated plant when it comes to indoor plants. It can stay without water for a longer period of time. It can even grow in low light conditions and with less water. There is no need for particular fertilizer to look after it and no special care is needed. It is one of the easy plants to maintain. It is a non-toxic plant and hence does not harm your children and pets. It is considered to be one of the best air purifying plants by NASA. Sansevieria removes at least 107 known air pollutants, including carbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide, formaldehyde, chloroform, benzene, xylene, trichloroethylene and many others. It also has the ability to eliminate bad odor from its surroundings.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "In my previous blogs, I had discussed about many plant growing techniques. The previous blogs have explained about Germination, Maintaining the plants during summer, Growing plants from the bulbs, The technique of growing plants in the air or moist environment called Aeroponics, the technique of growing plants in water called Hydroponics etc., Today I'm here to explain about a new technique of growing the plants effectively. This technique is called Grafting.\nWhat is Grafting?\n\nImage source\nGrafting is a technique of combining the tissues or the growing part of two different plants in order to improve the productivity of the plants. This may include the plants of the same category or of a different category. The upper part of the combined plant is called the scion and the lower part is called the rootstock. As the name itself suggest, the roots of the rootstock plant will be in contact with the growing medium and the scion plant gets the nutrients required for its growth through the intersection or the junction where both the plants are combined. Grafting is an ancient technique which is said to be developed in the time of Roman Civilization. According to the studies, by 500 BC, grafting was well established and practiced in Rome. Grafting is also mentioned in the New Testament and there is a discussion about the grafting of wild olive trees which tells about the relationship between Jews and non-Jews. This technique does not modify the genetic characteristics of any plants. Both the plants retain their characteristic features and grow together as a single plant. \nMethods of Grafting\nThere are several methods of grafting the plants depending upon the requirement. Here are some of the methods which are commonly used in grafting.\n1. Approach Grafting:\n\nImage source\n\nImage sourceApproach Grafting is one method of grafting where two independent plants are joined together with the roots of both the plants below the soil. The distinctive feature of Approach Grafting is that two independently growing, self-sustaining plants are grafted together. As the roots of both the plants are in the soil, both the plants are sustainable to survive even if the grafting attempt fails. So this can be the best method to graft the plants. The stems of both the plants are partially chipped at a similar height and joined together using the thread or growing tape. The plants take a minimum 4 weeks to combine gradually and grow successfully. \n2. Bud Grafting:\n\nImage source\n\nImage sourceBudding is a process of combining two plants using the buds. The bud of one plant is placed in the stem of the other plant. Grafting rose plants is the most common example of Bud Grafting. In this method, a bud is removed from the parent plant, and the base of the bud is inserted beneath the bark of the stem by making a small slit such that the bud can be accommodated. Rest of the shoot has to be cut from the rootstock plant. Any extra bud that starts growing from the stem of the rootstock plant needs to be removed. A Budwood or Budstick is a part of the plant with several buds on it. A budwood is taken and placed in the slit made on the rootstock. The intersecting point is tied with a thread to make the combination happen effectively.\n3. Cleft Grafting:\n\nImage source\n\nImage sourceCleft Grafting is one of the easiest methods of Grafting. Two plants can be easily grafted by this method. Firstly you need to take a Rootstock or the bottom part of a plant and chop the top layer. A scion or the top layer of another plant is taken and chopped in V shape. A perpendicular slit is made on the Rootstock such that the scion can easily coincide with it. The scion is placed inside the rootstock and fixed firmly. The intersection is tightly packed using a thread or a tape.\n4. Whip Grafting or Tongue Grafting:\n\nImage source\n\nImage sourceWhip Grafting or Tongue Grafting is the oldest and most commonly used grafting method. This method is used for Apple and Pear trees. Two similar sized plants are to be taken for this method. The top portion of the Rootstock plant and the bottom portion of the scion plant is chopped diagonally such that the chopped portion of both the plants coincides perfectly. The chopped parts are placed one above the other providing a good contact between the Rootstock and the scion. The intersection is tightly packed using the thread or tape such that the contact is established effectively. A major strong point for whip grafting nursery stock is the smooth and straight trees that are produced by this method.\n5. Four-flap Grafting:\n\nImage source\nImage source\nFour-flap Grafting is another method of grafting the plants. This method resembles the peeling process of Banana. So can also be called as Banana Grafting. The top portion of the Rootstock plant is chopped off and flapped into four parts using the grafting knife. The outer layer of the rootstock is peeled to a certain length and the inner stem part is chopped off. Make sure not to peel off the outer layer from the stock. The outer layer of the Scion plant is chipped off to the same length such that the scion can be easily fixed inside the rootstock. The peeled layer is closed and tightly packed using a thread or a tape.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Astrology is a concept on which the life of a man will be depending. It is the basic concept followed by the Hindus and a few other religions. Plants and Trees have a great significance in Astrology. Nature is treated as the supreme power in Astrology. Our ancestors have given great prominence to plants and trees. Here are some of the trees and plants with (astro)logical point of view.\n1. Peepal Tree or Ashwatha Vriksha\n\nImage sourcePeepal tree is considered to be one of the most auspicious trees in astrology. Peepal tree is worshipped and considered as the essence of Trimurthis Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. There is a holy chant that proves it.\n\nMoolatho Brahma roopaya | madhyatho Vishnu roopine ||Agratha Shiva roopaya | Vriksha rajaya they namaha ||\n\n which means the root of Peepal tree is considered as Brahma, the creator; the trunk is considered as Vishnu, the protector and the top part of the tree is considered as Shiva, the destroyer.\n \n\nImage sourceThis tree is also called Kalpavriksha which means the tree that fulfills our wishes. It is believed that by worshipping this tree, the problem of infertility can be solved and the unmarried gets married. The shadow of this tree is proved to impact on our brain activities and keeps our mind calm.\n2. Tulsi or Holy Basil\n\nImage sourceTulsi or Holy Basil is one of the sacred and most worshipped plants. Tulsi is personified as a Goddess in the Vedas and is also called ‘Vaishnavi,’ as she is very dear to Lord Vishnu. Tulsi is believed to be the symbolic representation of the goddess on earth in the form of a plant. The Puranas say that Lord Vishnu will be exceptionally pleased if you worship the God with Tulsi. Hence the leaves of Tulsi is considered special while worshipping Lord Vishnu.\n\nImage source\nThis plant's importance is explained in the chant as\n\nYanmule sarvatirhaani | Yanmadhye sarvadevata||Yathagre sarvavedaascha| Tulsi taam namaamyaham ||\n\nwhich means I bow to the goddess Tulsi where all the holy river resides at its roots, all the gods reside at its stem and the Vedas reside at its top part. Tulsi also has medicinal value. Ayurveda recommends the use of its leaves for many ailments. It is boiled in water and consumed to cure cough and throat infections. Even ailments as serious as cancer can be prevented by eating few Tulsi leaves in the morning in empty stomach.\n3. Mango tree or Aamra Vriksha\n\nImage sourceMango is called the king of Fruits. It produces delicious fruits. It is considered as the symbol of love and affection. The leaves of this tree are predominantly used in almost all the religious ceremonies. A \"Purnakumbha\" is a pot filled with water and topped with fresh mango leaves and a coconut and considered to be the \"sthapana\" or the beginning of the puja. The pot symbolizes Mother Earth, water inside the pot is the essence of life, coconut is the divine consciousness and the mango leaves symbolize life. The whole \"Purnakumbha\" symbolizes Goddess Lakshmi and good fortune. The mango leaves are serially arranged using a thread and tied above the main door. This chain of leaves is called \"thoranam\". It is considered as the sign of prosperity. Hence \"thoranam\" is tied during the auspicious occasions. It is also believed that the negative energy gets repelled by the mango leaves.\nImage source\nSome of you may consider these practices spiritual and some may consider it a superstition. But there are definitely some logical reasons behind all these astrological practices. In the name of God, our ancestors have shown the importance of growing plants and trees. There is no harm in considering them God as they are very useful to the other living creatures in one or the other ways. These practices may look like imparting superstitions but they encourage growing more plants.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "We all know that vegetables are the main source of food. These vegetables can be any part of the plants. They can be flowers, fruits or leaves. Cabbage, Cauliflower, Broccoli etc., comes under the category of flowers. Brinjal, Tomato, Beans etc., come under fruits and Coriander, Palak, Methi etc., come under leaves. Apart from these categories, there is one more category of vegetables. They are root vegetables. These vegetables are basically the root part of the plant that grows under the soil. There are many such root vegetables. Today let us discuss about some of the root vegetables.\n1. Carrot:\n\na. Plant category: Vegetable.b. Germination time: 15 to 20 days.c. The temperature required: 12°C to 26°c.d. Harvest time: 60 to 75 days from germination.\n\n\nImage sourceCarrot is one of the most commonly used vegetables across the world. It is a hard vegetable which is mostly orange or red in color. It can be consumed both cooked as well as raw. Carrot is a single produce crop that can be grown at home without any special knowledge. Winter and rainy seasons are the best seasons to grow carrots. It needs wet soil and cold weather to grow well. They can be either grown in pots or directly in the land. As we know Carrot need cool weather they grow quickly in 12°c to 26°c temperature. At this temperature, Carrot’s germination process will be very quick. It will take 15 to 20 days to germinate from sowing. During that period soil should be moist.\n\nWe can maintain the seeds in the tray at the beginning. But when the plant reaches 2 to 3 inches in length it requires some more space to grow. Sowing directly into the pot or to the land is the best way to cultivate. I suggest using nutrient-rich soil to sow the seeds as they contain all the required nutrients. As carrot plants prefer moist soil, it is better to mix cocopeat with soil. Coco peat has the ability to hold water. Keep the plants outdoor because Carrot needs 3 to 4 hours sunlight everyday. Once the saplings are transplanted, they should be treated with good fertilizers. Using an organic fertilizer is better. They do not spoil the natural essence of the soil. \nWatering tips:\nAs I have mentioned earlier, Carrot is a cool weather crop. So it takes more water to grow. If we are providing proper water it will grow soon. Below instructions will help you while wateringSummer: Water should be two days once. In case the top surface of the soil is fully dry spray the water once again.Winter: Water should be three days onceRainy: If rainwater is flowing to the plant, no need of watering. In case not, water it once in three days.\n\nHarvesting:\n\nImage source\nIf you are providing proper water, Fertilizer and compost, carrots will take 60 to 75 days to grow from the day of germination. Most of the carrots are ready to harvest when the shoulders are 1/2 to 3/4 inch in diameter, but again, there is much variation depending on the variety. We have to remove the complete plant by the hedge shear safely. It can’t grow again.\n\n2. Radish:\n\na. Plant category: Vegetable.b. Germination time: 5 to 8 days.c. The temperature required: 15°C.d. Harvest time: 30 to 45 days from germination.\n\n\nImage source\nRadish is another root vegetable that is used widely across the world. This vegetable comes in two shapes namely round and long. It is either white or red in color. Similar to carrot, radish is also a single produce crop. It can be either consumed raw or cooked. Radish is a cool weather crop so we can grow in the winter season. Cool climate helps to germinate quickly and healthy. Radishes need 15°c temperature to grow well. At this temperature, it gives a good yield. Radish takes 5 to 8 days to germinate from the seeds. During the germination process, we should keep the soil moist and provide sufficient water on time. \n \n\nImage source\nBefore sprouting, we can maintain the seeds in a tray. Later it needs more space to develop the roots. So once the plant reaches 2 to 3 inches, transplant to the pot or directly to the land. Using nutrient-rich soil with organic fertilizer makes the plant grow better and healthy. You can also mix cocopeat with the soil and then transplant the saplings. Radish plant needs a minimum of 5 to 6 hours of sunlight. So, if you are planning to grow the plant indoors, make sure to select the place with sufficient sunlight.\n \nWatering tips:\nYou need to water the radish once a day during summer, and once in 2 days during winter and rainy season. Make sure not to over water, else the root of the plant gets rotten.\nHarvesting:\n\nImage sourceRadish will be ready for the harvest within 30 to 45 days of germination. You need to harvest the radish before the root is 1 inch in diameter. Do not leave them in the soil long after their mature stage. Remove the plant, cut off the green part and use the radish. As they are single produce crop, they do not grow again. \nBeetroot:\n\na. Plant category: Vegetable.b. Germination time: 10 to 15 days.c. The temperature required: 10°c to 23°c.d. Harvest time: 55 to 75 days from germination.\n\n\nImage source\nBeetroot is another popularly known vegetable with its deep purple color. It is a round shaped vegetable that can be consumed both raw as well as cooked. As beetroots are root vegetables, these are also single produce crops. Similar to Carrot and Radish, Beetroot is also a winter season crop. It requires cool weather to grow. It germinates faster in the winter season as this plant needs a lot of moisture. It requires nearly 10°C - 23°C temperatures. In this temperature, beetroot grows well. It takes 10 to 15 days to germinate from the seeds. You can either use a seedling tray to germinate the seeds and transfer the sapling to a bigger pot later or directly sow the seeds in the ground. Make sure to provide good quality potting mix so that the plants grow well.\n \n\nImage source\nMixing the cocopeat with the soil is a good idea to grow these plants as they prefer moist growing medium. Cocopeat is made of coconut fiber which has a good water holding capacity. Hence plants get ample time to get in contact with water. I suggest using organic fertilizers and compost instead of chemical fertilizers. You can also prepare organic compost at your house out of the kitchen waste using the composter kit. This not only avoids the wastage of food but also provides chemical free compost to your lovely garden.\nWatering tips:\nIn the rainy season, most all plants do not take more water. It requires less watering to grow.In Summer: Water 3 days once.In Winter: 5 to 6 days once.In Rainy: No need in case rainwater directly flowing to the plant. Otherwise 15 days once.This suggestion is with the assumption that you use cocopeat based potting mix.\nHarvesting:\n\nImage source\nBeetroots will take 55 to 75 days to reach harvesting stage from the day of germination. Till the harvest, we need to care for the plant by providing the water, potting mix, and essential nutrients. When the top side of the leaves reaches 6 to 7 inches in the length, it is ready to harvest. You could see the Beetroot shooting up from the soil. You can remove the fully grown beetroots with bare hands or use a trowel. As beetroots are single produce crop, they do not grow again.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Everyone loves to eat fruits. Each fruit has its own characteristic fragrance and taste. Each of the kind contains different vital nutrients. In other words, fruits can be called the 'Packet of Nutrients'. Everyone irrespective of age limits enjoys the taste of food. But today, we are not getting healthy fruit. Most of the fruits sold in markets are artificially ripened using chemicals. These chemically grown fruits spoil our health instead of improving our health. Why can't we grow some fruits in a healthy way without any chemicals? Yes, we can. Here are some of the fruits plants that can be easily grown at home.\n1. Watermelon:\n\n\na. Plant category: Fruit.b. Germination time: 7 to 10 days.c. The temperature required: 20°C.d. Harvest time: 65 to 90 days from germination. \n\nWatermelon is one of the common fruit that is available everyday. There is nobody who has not tasted this yummy fruit. This fruit is most seen during summer as it has a great hydrating ability. It can be directly eaten or can be crushed into juice and consumed. Watermelon helps prevent both low potassium and magnesium deficiency, and these are two critical nutrients used to help remedy high blood pressure naturally. Consuming proper amounts of potassium and magnesium from a healthy diet is correlated with overall reducing the risk for cardiovascular diseases.Watermelons can be easily grown at home using seeds. Sow the seeds about 2 inches deep in the soil. The seeds take about 7 to 10 days to germinate. Watermelons are the warm-weather crop. So it can sustain heavy sunlight. It requires direct sunlight so it is better to grow in outdoor or place it where it can get the sunlight properly In case you are planting the Watermelon indoor that will grow less abundantly due to less sunlight. So it is better to grow it outdoors for the best result. Watermelon needs 20°c to 25°c temperature to grow. At this temperature, it can grow well.\n \n\nImage sourceUse a well-drained good potting mix to grow the plants. It is better to use organic fertilizers instead of chemical one. The chemical fertilizers spoil the fertility of the soil. As it is a summer crop, Watermelon does not require more water. In summer, water once in 2 days and 3 days once in the winter and rainy season. Bacterial Fruit Blotch, Anthracnose, Downy Mildew, Alternaria Leaf Spot, Cercospora Leaf Spot are the common diseases. If your plants are facing these problems, we advise using the \"Neem oil\". Watermelon plant will take 65-90 days to harvest from the sow. When a melon is ripe, it turns to creamy yellow from near white. Cut the Watermelon from the knife or in the pruning secateurs safely. No need to remove the plants it will re-grow.\n2. Papaya:\n\n\na. Plant category: Fruit.b. Germination time: 15 to 20 days.c. The temperature required: 20°C to 25°C.d. Harvest time: nearly 7 to 9 months from germination. \n\nThe orange colored melon-like fruit is native to southern Mexico and Central America but can be grown in most tropical areas. Ripe papaya is commonly used around the world to make juice or as a delicious addition to salads or desserts. Papaya is also commonly used as a digestive enzyme to improve digestion. Papaya contains a special digestive enzyme called papain, which makes it a powerful digestive enzyme. It can also help the body to heal wounds, to reduce inflammation, to purify the blood etc., It also has the ability to cure kidney stone problem. Papayas can be grown from seeds at home. Summer season is the best season to grow Papaya plants. In the summer season, Papaya starts to grow soon. Papayas are warm weather crops. So require the temperature between 20°c to 25°c to grow quickly. Papaya will take 15 to 20 days to germinate. During the germination period, the soil must be moist. Papaya does not require more water. Three days once in winter and rainy season, two days once in the summer season would be enough. Overwatering can invite the diseases. It can grow with less sunlight. But it needs at least two to three hours of sunlight.\n \n\nImage sourceProvide good potting mix that is rich in nutrients so that the plants grow healthy. The soil must be well drained such that the excess water can flow through. Bacterial leaf spot, Anthracnose, Phytophthora fruit and stem rot are the common diseases found in papaya plants. Use organic pesticides like Neem oil to cure the plants. Avoid chemical fertilizers so that you get chemical free and organic yield. Papaya will take seven to eight months to harvest from the seeding. Papaya fruit should be harvested when some yellow shows on the fruit, but before turning fully yellow. You can pluck the Papaya directly from hand. But handle the plant gently while doing so. You can also cut the Papaya from pruning secateurs safely, it will re-grow. \nMuskmelon:\n\nImage source\na. Plant category: Fruit.b. Germination time: 7 to 10 days.c. The temperature required: minimum of 20°C.d. Harvest time: nearly 70 to 100 days from germination. \nMuskmelon is one variety of melon that is commonly found everywhere. It can be either eaten or crushed into juice. It has a very unique taste that makes everyone to consume it more often. Muskmelon is a high fiber fruit, with an abundance of vitamins A and C, and potassium. This makes muskmelon a nutrient-dense food, meaning its nutritional benefits outweigh its calorie content. Muskmelon is a summer crop. Muskmelon will grow quickly in the summer season. During the hot weather, Melon’s germination process will be strong. During the germination period, soil should be moist and water will be most important. If we are providing water on the time it will take 10 days to germinate. Muskmelon needs 15°c to 21°c of temperature to grow quickly. In this temperature, Muskmelon grows well. They are basically outdoor plants, but we can grow it indoor also. In case you are planning to grow indoor, place it where it can get at least three to four hours sunlight everyday. They require more water. So it needs regular water in summer, two days once in winter and rainy season.\n \n\nImage source Well-drained potting mix helps the plant to grow well and absorb sufficient moisture. A potting mix containing cocopeat helps in retaining moisture content for a quite long period as Muskmelons might lack water content. Use organic fertilizers and plant foods to provide essential nutrients to the plants. Do not use any chemical fertilizers. Instead, you can prepare organic compost at home with the food residues using compost bin. Aphids and cucumber beetles can affect melons.\"Neem oil\" is a natural pesticide. So it avoids the diseases. Muck melon will take 70 to 100 to harvest from the seeding. When melons reach full size and stem turn brown, they are ready for harvest. Cut the melons off the plant by hedge shear safely. No need to remove the plants because It will re-grow.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

In the previous blogs, we have discussed about Fruits with the Antioxidant property, 2 Apples can prevent major health risks and Top 4 plants that can prevent health hazards. Plants are the major source of food for any living being. They provide the essential nutrients and benefits to the body. But here are some of the foods which not only benefits the body parts but also resembles the body parts. Here are few such foods that not only looks similar to the body parts but also benefits the body parts. After reading this article you will definitely say \"Nature is so creative and artistic\".\n1. Carrots - Eyes:\n\nImage sourceCarrots are one of the most popular and most commonly used vegetables in the world. They can be eaten raw, cooked or crushed into juice. Regularly consuming carrots or carrot juice benefits the body in so many amazing ways. It is very important for your eye health. You can also observe when it is cut horizontally, it resembles the eye. Eating carrots carrot juice regularly will help you maintain healthy eyes and vision throughout your life. Instead of consuming carrots in raw form, you can drink carrot juice that carries the same eye health benefits. It contains three very important nutrients named beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. Carrots contain vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene. Vitamin A is one of the most crucial nutrients necessary for protecting eye health and vision, especially as someone ages. These nutrients present in carrot can cure various forms of eye disorders including macular degeneration and even blindness. Lutein and zeaxanthin are capable of reducing the risk of age-related vision loss.\n2. Walnut - Brain:\n\nImage sourceHave you ever noticed that a walnut resembles the human brain? Yes. It not only resembles the human brain but also benefits the brain. Walnuts nutrition has the ability to support the brain. It has been scientifically proven to be a true “brain food” and a leader among all nuts. The omega-3 fats present in Walnuts are important for supporting memory and thought process. Due to lack of essential omega-3s, many people suffer from higher incidences of depression. This includes age-related conditions like dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and other memory impairments. Omega-3s support correct brain function. There is biological evidence of low levels of omega-3 fats contributing to depression as well as a number of other behavioral and cognitive disorders. Walnuts work as a natural remedy for depression, considering that essential fats are directly used to create cells’ outer membranes and help with neurotransmitter function. Omega-3 fats help to form the soft, fluid outer-lining of cells that gives them the ability to communicate with each other. \n3. Tomato - Heart:\n\nImage sourceTomato is a common fruit used as food. People assume it as a vegetable as it is used with other vegetables for cooking. But scientifically it is a fruit. It can be either eaten raw or cooked. It can also be crushed into juice and consumed. Most of us have seen this fruit and have used it normally. Have you ever felt that it resembles heart? Yes, it resembles the human heart. If you cut the tomato, you find different chambers inside it. Similarly, there are chambers inside the heart. Apart from the resemblance, the tomato is very beneficial to the heart. Tomato contains antioxidants, especially lycopene which is known for fighting free radical damage and protect the heart against oxidative stress. This provides protection related to heart disease and lowers the risk for heart attacks or strokes. Research has found that treatment with antioxidant-rich tomato extract can also reduce high blood pressure, lower cholesterol naturally and improve blood vessel health.\n4. Ginger - Stomach:\n\nImage sourceGinger is one of the very useful plant parts when it comes to medicine. It has a very prominent role in the field of Ayurveda. It has the ability to cure many common health problems. If you look closely, you’ll see that ginger has a similar shape to the stomach. Not only shape, it can cure many stomach related problems. Several studies have found that ginger could help prevent the formation of stomach ulcers. Stomach ulcers are painful sores that form in the lining of the stomach and cause symptoms like indigestion, fatigue, heartburn and abdominal discomfort. Ginger is well-known for its ability to treat nausea, a sensation of unease and discomfort in the upper stomach. One of the most impressive benefits of ginger is its anti-cancer properties. The presence of a powerful compound called 6-gingerol is responsible for blocking cancer cell growth and development for ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "In today's world, we are just running a mechanical life. Nobody is thinking about their health and the environment. At the end of the day, health is very important to achieve our goals. In the previous blogs I had discussed about The fruits that prevent major health risks and Plants that can avoid health hazards. Today I'm discussing about the life savers inside our body, the antioxidants. \nThe human body is full of mysteries. Many chemical reactions and processes continuously take place inside the body. Our body contains both antioxidants and free radicals at all times. It can be compared to a battery with both positive and negative terminals. Our body contains both the cause and its cure. Some antioxidants are produced inside the body itself, while are obtained by eating high antioxidant foods that double as anti-inflammatory foods. Our body also produces free radicals as byproducts of cellular reactions. For example, the liver produces and uses free radicals to detoxify the body, while white blood cells send free radicals to destroy bacteria, viruses and damaged cells. So both antioxidants and free radicals are important for our body. \nWhat is an Antioxidant?\n\nImage source\nAn antioxidant is a substance that inhibits oxidation used to counteract the decrease of stored food products or removes potentially damaging oxidizing agents in our body. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, leading to chain reactions that may damage cells. Antioxidants control the free radicals and prevent the cell damage.\n \n\nImage SourceWhen certain types of oxygen molecules enter the body, they cause oxidative damage, which in turn leads to the formation of free radicals. When the antioxidant level in the body is lower than that of free radicals, due to poor nutrition the cells get damaged. In order to prevent cell damage caused due to free radicals, antioxidants play a very important role. Hence we need to consume foods which are rich in antioxidants. Here are some of the fruits that are rich in antioxidants.\n1. Oranges:\n\nImage sourceOrange is one of the common fruit that we come across everyday. This citrus fruit is rich in vitamin C. Oranges contain a good amount of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It helps in producing the water-soluble antioxidant in the body by avoiding free radicals and preventing damage to your cells. Vitamin C improves our immune system by preventing colds and ear infections. Oranges are low in calories and full of nutrients. They promote clear, healthy, skin and can help to lower our risk for many diseases as part of an overall healthy and varied diet. Orange juice is considered to be healthy due to their high content of antioxidants, which help to reduce harmful free radicals in our body.\n2. Strawberries:\n\nImage sourceStrawberries are one of the most loved types of fruit for their sweet taste and versatility in recipes- but they also have an impressive amount of health benefits. Most of the health benefits associated with strawberry nutrition are due to the presence of anti-inflammatory antioxidants. Strawberries contain anti-aging flavonoid antioxidants called anthocyanin and catechin which are said to be capable of decreasing the risk for chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Strawberries are a high source of various antioxidants including uteolin, gallic acid, flavonols, quercetrin, and many others too. Strawberries contain two essential micronutrients which act as antioxidants in the body, vitamin A which is in the form of beta-carotene and vitamin C in the form of ascorbic acid. \n3. Mangoes:\n\nImage sourceMangoes are considered to be the king of fruits. Irrespective of age groups, everyone loves its characteristic taste and aroma. Apart from taste and aroma they also have some health benefits. They contain vitamins, minerals and enzymes to benefit the health. Mangoes are also a great high-fiber food and high-antioxidant food which can fight against free radicals. Mangoes also provide vital minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium, and powerful antioxidants such as zeaxanthin, quercetin, astragalin and beta-carotene. They contain high amounts of pectin, a soluble fiber that can help naturally lower cholesterol levels in the blood. The mangoes contain enzymes for breaking down protein. So they help in digestion and elimination of the food. Mangoes are high in pectin, which not only helps in decreasing cholesterol levels in the blood but can also guard against prostate cancer. A compound within pectin combines with galectin 3, a protein that plays a strong part in fighting all stages of cancer. Mangoes are rich in beta-carotene, which also helps in improving the immune system. The extra beta-carotene is converted into vitamin A inside the body, and vitamin A can help you fight free radicals that can damage your body and health.\n \nApart from these fruits, there are some vegetables like Broccoli, Beetroot, Spinach etc., which are also capable of producing antioxidants inside the body. \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

Everyone will be aware of sowing the seeds and growing the plants. What if I show you an innovative way to grow plants? Grow healthy plants from Seed Bombs. Yes. it's a seed bomb made in the similar shape of the vegetable. \nWhat are Seed Bombs?\n\nImage sourceSeed Bombs or Seed Balls are clay balls consisting of different kind of seeds in it. They are made of clay, preferably volcanic pyroclastic red clay. The medium may also contains various additives such as humus or compost. These are placed around the seeds, at the center of the ball, to provide microbial inoculants.The technique for creating seed balls was introduced by Japanese natural farming pioneer named Masanobu Fukuoka. The technique was also used in ancient Egypt to repair farms after the annual spring flooding of the Nile. In modern times, during the period of the Second World War, the Japanese botanists working in a government lab who lived on the mountainous island of Shikoku wanted to find a technique that would increase food production without taking away from the land already allocated for traditional rice production. This led them to introduce the technique called Seed Bombing.\n \n\nImage source\nToday seed bombing is already regarded as a practical reforestation technique in a few countries. More than a million hectares of well-stocked forests in the United States, Canada, China, Australia, and New Zealand demonstrate its success. Some of these forests have been established despite seemingly adverse conditions-for example, on steep slopes and on overburden from strip mines.Although aerial seeding technology has been used mainly in industrialized countries on a larger scale from a commercial point of view, it can also be introduced in every cities, villages and town. These are done on a smaller scale with less expenditure. Many schools and educational institutions take this initiative and encourage their students in seed bombing. The students are taken to the countryside and the seed balls prepared are thrown wherever sufficient space is available. \nHow to prepare seed bombs?\n\nImage sourcePreparing simple seed bombs is a child's play. Here are the instructions for preparing seed bombs.\nStep - 1\n\nImage sourceMix the seed, clay, and compost together in a bowl to a ratio of three handfuls of clay, five handfuls of compost, and one handful of seed. \nStep - 2\n\nImage source\nAdd water slowly and gradually such that the mixture does not become too watery. Step - 3\n\nImage source\nMix it all together until you get a consistency that you can form clay balls. Step - 4\n\nImage source\nKeep the seed balls in sunlight and let it dry for at least three hours.Step - 5\n\nImage source\nOnce the seed bombs are dried, you can use them for sowing.\n \n\nImage sourceYou need to make the seed bombs at least 2 to 3 cms big so that the seeds can stay safe inside them until it starts to germinate.\nAdvantages of Seed Bombs:\n\n1. With the help of seed bombing technique, you can sow the seeds in a larger area as it is difficult to sow the seeds in the conventional method.2. As the seeds are covered with clay, you can avoid insects, animals and birds from eating the seeds.3. You can create the vegetation in large area with the lesser amount of time.4. As you are making the seed bombs at home, they are completely organic and eco-friendly. Hence there is no harm to the environment.\n\nYou can also buy these seed bombs from online stores. Some stores sell the seed bomb made in the similar shape of the vegetable. These seed bombs are made of clay. They are colored with natural watercolors. The respective seeds are placed inside the clay bombs. Each seed bomb contains 3 to 5 seeds in it. You need to just sow them in the soil and water them. The clay melts and mixes with the growing soil and the seeds start to germinate within 10 to 15 days as per their germination time. This is the best way to make your kids interested in gardening. This can also be the best gift you can give irrespective of age groups. You can encourage your children for growing the plants with Seed Bombing technique.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Plants need certain basic components to grow well. These components include seeds, soil, water, sunlight etc., Plants get all the essential nutrients through the soil. But in today's concrete world filled with flats and apartments, getting a place with good soil to grow the plants is impossible. No need to get discouraged. There are alternative techniques to grow plants without soil. In the previous blog, I had discussed about Aeroponics. Here is another way to show your affection towards the plants. It is hydroponics. This is an innovative technique to grow plants without soil.\nWhat is Hydroponics?\n\nImage sourceHydroponics is the method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions and water. The roots of the plants are immersed in the water containing nutrient solution. The nutrients provided to the plants in hydroponics are mostly the byproduct of fish waste, duck manure, or normal nutrients. The word Hydroponics has derived from Greek words where Hydro means 'Water' and ponos means 'Growth'.\n \nHydroponic culture\n \nImage sourceAn author and botanist named Francis Bacon was the first person who started the Hydroponic system. In the year 1627, he wrote a book called 'Sylva Sylvarum' or 'A Natural History' which contained the details about growing a terrestrial plant without soil. Since then, many research was conducted to study about hydroponics. In 1699, another author named John Woodward published an article about water culture experiments with spearmint. He had grown two plants, one in normal water and another in pure distilled water. He found that the plants which were grown in normal water sources grew better than plants in distilled water. Two German botanists named Julius von Sachs and Wilhelm Knop conducted an experiment from 1859 to 1875 and came up with a list of most essential components to carry out Hydroponics. This gave a big positive impact towards the development of soilless cultivation of plants. The growth of terrestrial plants without soil in mineral nutrient solutions was then called as solution culture. Many research and teaching technique were conducted and is still widely used as a growing technique. Solution culture is now considered as a type of hydroponics where there is no inert medium. \nHow do the plants grow in Hydroponics?\n\nImage sourceThe plants are provided with required nutrients for its growth. If you give a plant exactly the nutrients it needs at the right time in a correct quantity, the plant will be as healthy as is genetically possible. With hydroponics, this is an easy task compared to soil. The plants are grown in an inert growing medium and a perfectly balanced, pH adjusted nutrient solution is delivered to the roots in a highly soluble form. This allows the plant to absorb the required nutrients with very little effort when compared to soil where the roots must search out the nutrients and extract them. This is true even when using rich, organic soil and best nutrients. The energy expended by the roots in this process is energy better spent on vegetative growth and fruit and flower production.\nIf you grow two plants of the same kind using soil for one and hydroponics for the other, you will almost immediately see the difference in their growth. You can find faster, better growth and comparatively good yield from hydroponics. These are the reasons that hydroponics method is adopted for commercial food production as well as by hobby gardeners at home.\nTypes of Hydroponics:\nThere are many types of hydroponics used across the globe. Some of the best hydroponic systems are made of different types of hydroponics into one hybrid hydroponic system. Here are some of the easy and commonly used techniques.\n1. Deep water culture method:\n\nImage sourceDeepwater Culture method which is also known as the reservoir method is one of the easiest methods for growing plants with hydroponics. In this method, the roots are suspended in a nutrient solution. An air pump is introduced to oxygenate the nutrient solution in order to avoid the roots of the plants from drowning. You need to prevent direct sunlight from penetrating the system, as it can support algae growth and hence the whole system gets affected.The primary benefit to using a Deepwater Culture method is that there are no drip or spray emitters to clog. This makes the system a perfect choice for organic hydroponics, as hydroponics systems that use organic nutrients are more prone to clogs.\n2. Wicking method:\n\nImage sourceThe Wicking method is one of the simplest types of hydroponic system. This is a passive system, hence there are no moving parts in the system. The concept behind wicking is that you have a material such as cotton, that is surrounded by a growing medium with one end of the wick material placed in the nutrient solution. The solution is then wicked to the roots of the plant. The nutrient solution is drawn into the supporting medium from the reservoir using a wick with one end dipped in the reservoir and the other end connected to the supporting medium. This system can use a variety of supporting medium such as Perlite, Vermiculite, Foam with a hole in the center etc., The roots pass through the gap in the supporting medium to obtain the nutrients. \n3. Nutrient Film Method:\n\nImage sourceThis is the most commonly used hydroponics method across the world. This system has a constant flow of nutrient solution so no timer required for the submersible pump. The nutrient solution is pumped into the growing tube and flows over the roots of the plants, and then drains back into the reservoir. The nutrient solution is on a slight tilt surface so that the solution will flow with the force of gravity. This type of system works very well because the roots of a plant absorb more oxygen from the air than from the nutrient solution itself. Since only the tips of the roots come in contact with the nutrient solution, the plant is able to get more oxygen which helps in a faster rate of growth. There is usually no growing medium used other than air, which saves the expense of replacing the growing medium after every crop. Normally the plant is supported in a small plastic basket with the roots suspended into the nutrient solution.\n4. Dripping method:\n\nImage sourceDripping method is probably the most widely used type of hydroponic system in the world. A timer controls a submerged pump in the nutrient solution. The timer turns the pump on and nutrient solution is dripped onto the base of each plant by a small drip line. In a Recovery Drip System, the excess nutrient solution is collected back in the reservoir for re-use. A recovery system uses nutrient solution a bit more efficiently. As the excess solution is reused, this also allows for the use of a more inexpensive timer because a recovery system doesn't require precise control of the watering cycles. A recovery system can have large shifts in the pH and nutrient strength levels that require periodic checking and adjusting.When it comes to the Non-recovery system, it needs to have a more precise timer so that watering cycles can be adjusted to ensure that the plants get enough nutrient solution and the runoff is kept to a minimum. The non-recovery system requires less maintenance due to the fact that the excess nutrient solution isn't recycled back into the reservoir, so the nutrient strength and pH of the reservoir will not vary. This means that you can fill the reservoir with pH adjusted nutrient solution and then forget it until you need to mix more. \nAdvantages of Hydroponics:\n\nImage source\nGrowing with hydroponics comes with many advantages. Here are the advantages.a. It can increase the rate of growth in your plants. With the proper setup, your plants will mature up to 25% faster and produce up to 30% more than the same plants grown in soil.b. Your plants will grow bigger and faster because they will not have to work as hard to obtain nutrients. c. The root system gets the exact nutrients that it needs, so the plant will focus more on growing instead of struggling to absorb the nutrients.d. A hydroponic system will also use less water than soil-based plants because the system is enclosed, which results in less evaporation. e. The hydroponic system reduces waste and pollution from soil runoff as it does not use soil medium for the growth.All of this is possible through careful control of your nutrient solution and pH levels. \nDisadvantages of hydroponics:\nDespite the fact that a hydroponics system has so many advantages, there are actually a few disadvantages as well.a. The quality hydroponics system of any size will cost more than its soil counterpart.b. A large-scale hydroponics system can take a lot of time to setup. c. You will have to monitor and balance your pH and nutrient levels on a daily basis.d. The pump failure can kill off your plants within hours depending on the size of your system. e. The plants die quickly if the growing medium can’t store water like soil as the plants are dependent on a fresh supply of water.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "A garden consists of many varieties of plants. Some produce beautiful flowers and some do not. Few plants can tolerate high sunlight, some are capable of surviving in less sunlight and some can survive with minimum water. Some depend on other plants for food and some feed on insects. Growing each kind of plants has a technique. Previously I had given some details about Topiary technique which can enhance the beauty of your garden. Here is another such technique. Growing creepers and climbers by using support structure is one such technique. This technique can be implemented by Trellis.\nWhat is Trellis?\n\nImage sourceA Trellis is a support structure, usually made from an open framework or lattice of intersecting pieces of wood, bamboo or metal that is normally made used to support climbing plants, especially shrubs. It is an outdoor garden frame which can be used to grow vines or other climbing plants. It is a method used to decorate your garden in a unique way. Trellis is common in Europe and other rose-growing areas, and many climbing rose varieties are grown with the help of a trellis to reach their potential as garden plants. Some climbers wrap themselves around a trellis without any help but some needs to be tied to the framework.\nTrellis culture:\n\nImage sourceTrellis has been mentioned in literature and many botanical works throughout history. An author named Pliny the Younger wrote about trellises in some of his letters about gardens during the first and second centuries. In the 19th century, a port named Walt Whitman has also mentioned a trellis in his work \"Give me the Splendid, Silent Sun\". The trellis was used to support shrubs in espalier, also to separate roads from thickets and diverse sections of vegetable gardens. These sorts of fences were made by the gardeners. Two French architects and landscape designers named André Le Nôtre and Jules Hardouin-Mansart were the persons who made the trellis became an object of decoration. They made different trellis structures based on the type of plants they grew. Hence Trellis was a part of garden architecture and landscaping.\n \n\nImage sourceIn the 20th Century, landscape architects such as Edouard François and Gilles Clément used the trellis to provide the modern architecture a new elevation. Nowadays this has become a new trend in gardening. A garden trellis can add so much charm and functionality to a garden. It offers supports for beautiful flowering or fruiting vines and add more growing area for small gardens, and helps to create attractive outdoor spaces such as beautiful walls and fences.\n \n\nImage sourceCucumbers, squash, peas, pole beans, tomatoes and sweet potatoes are some of the most common climber vegetables. These vegetables are categorized into three types based on their climbing nature. Some have tendrils, some are twiners, and some are scramblers. Knowing the difference in their growing tendencies can help you choose the right support structure.\nTypes of Trellis:\n\n1. Flat Trellis or Wall Trellis:\n\nImage sourceThis type of trellis, also known as wall trellis, is ideal for creeping vegetables like peas, cucumbers and pole beans. This structure is very popular because it is sturdy and thick and can support the weight of various types of climbing vines and vegetables. A flat trellis is also very flexible because you can make it large or small, depending on the size of your space and your chosen plant. If you are interested in growing pole beans, you should make a large trellis because this plant can grow as high as 15 feet. You can use wood, plastic or metal materials for this trellis, provided that the material you pick can support the type of vegetable that you want to grow.\nTower Trellis or Obelisk Trellis:\n\nImage sourceThis kind of trellis is more popularly known as the obelisk trellis. It requires sufficient space and is ideal for landscaping. This pyramidal trellis allows you to grow different types of vegetables on each of its sides. However, there are certain kinds of plants that grow only on this type of structure. Tomatoes, peppers, gourds and melons grow well in a tower or tepee-style trellises. When using these tower trellis, it is important to make a support for each fruit or vegetable. Many climbing vines or plants cannot hold the weight of their fruits. Individual structures or strips allow Pumpkins, Bitter gourds, Bottle Gourds, Sponge Gourds, Watermelons, Musk Melons and squash to grow really big. Materials that are commonly used for structures are metal and wood.\nPlant Box Trellis:\n\nImage sourceIf you are interested to grow a vegetable garden but only have a small space available, the best type of trellis is the Plant box trellis. It is very easy to grow vegetables using a horizontal trellis or lattice attached on one of its sides. Even if you only have a small patio or a window space, you can grow your own vegetable using this type of trellis. However, not all creeping plants can grow well on this trellis, you need to select certain vegetables that neither grows very tall nor has very deep roots. Some plants that are suitable for this type of trellis are squash and miniature pumpkins.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Everyone loves gardening. Having a wonderful garden with beautiful plants is everyone's wish. Some people buy plants from the local nursery or from gardening websites and start their gardening journey. But they won't be knowing the right way to grow those plants. In the previous blogs I had discussed about Easy gardening tips for beginners and Germination hacks. They will try to grow in some random way but it won't work. At this point, they will lose their interest in gardening. As they are unaware of gardening methods, mistakes happen and they won't be able to maintain a successful garden. So today I'm here to explain you some common gardening mistakes that happen in a garden and some tips to overcome those mistakes.\n1. Watering:\n\nImage sourceWater is very essential for a plant to grow healthy. But the amount of water the plant needs must be taken into consideration. Overwatering won't help your plants in any way. Overwater creates lack of oxygen and the roots rot. The water accumulated in the roots causes the disease called Root Rot. Once the root starts rotting, it loses the ability to absorb the nutrients from the soil and hence the plants will perish. The plants die if they don't get sufficient water. The nutrients present in the soil dissolve in water and the plants absorb the nutrients from the water. If the plant does not get sufficient water, they start losing moisture and hence perish. You need to water for the plant growth in a proper way.\n\nImage sourceThere are certain plants which require more water and some plants like Succulents can survive with the limited supply of water. The weather also matters while watering. Plants do not need water during rainy season unless they are not exposed to rain. During summer, the soil gets evaporated faster. Watering the plants thoroughly is very important during summer. So, you need to know about the plant's nature before watering them.\n2. Sowing the seeds:\n\nImage sourceThe first thing you must know when it comes to sowing the seeds is about the quality of the seeds. Most of the beginners make this mistake as they won't be aware of the seeds quality. You will be partially successful if you choose good quality seeds. Not only good quality seeds matter, but also the sowing method matters. The sowing depth depends on the size of the seeds. If you are using smaller seeds like Mustard, Coriander, Chilli etc., no need to sow it deep inside the soil. Just sprinkling the seeds and covering it with a layer of soil would be enough. If at all you are using bigger seeds like Mango, Avocado etc., you need to sow them deep inside the soil as per the requirement.\n\nImage sourceIf you are sowing the smaller seeds deep inside the soil, they won't get the nutrients provided by you and hence won't germinate. If you sow the bigger seeds on the surface, they won't get sufficient space for developing the roots and hence perish. So the sowing depth depends on the size of the seeds you choose. \n3. Selecting the growing medium:\n\nImage sourceAs you all know, growing medium plays a very important role in the growth of a plant. You need to select an appropriate growing medium for the plants which you have selected to grow. Here, most of the people make mistakes. Certain plants need soil with air space so that their roots can expand freely. They need air space for the roots to breath. As there will be enough space for the excess water to flow down, loose soil does not allow the water to accumulate near the roots. This can avoid root rot.\n\nImage source If you are trying to grow those plants in a hard soil without the air space, obviously the plants cannot develop and hence die. This does not mean you have to use completely loose soil. If you are using completely loose soil, the roots do not get sufficient support and hence cannot develop. The soil must be sufficiently packed such that the roots can hold the soil and grow well and should be sufficiently loose such that the excess water won't get accumulated. \n4. Planting off the season:\n\nImage sourceWhen it comes to the sowing season, most of the beginners commit this mistake. Everyone will be enthusiastic while having a beautiful garden. This enthusiasm can lead you to commit some silly mistakes. Each plant requires some optimal atmosphere for its growth. They require a specific temperature for germinating and growing healthy. For instance, warm-season crops such as beans, tomatoes and squash grow well in warm weather. They cannot tolerate cold weather. Similarly, cool weather crops like Capsicum, Radish, Green Peas can grow well in cool weather. They cannot tolerate high temperature and sunlight.\n\nImage source\nSo, you need to grow suitable plants according to the season. Instead, if you grow some random plants which cannot grow in that particular season, it is waste of time, energy as well as your money. Hence know about the seasonal plant and grow them accordingly.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "The season plays a very important role in the growth of plants. As the plants require a certain optimal temperature, plants have been categorized according to the seasons. In the previous blog, I had discussed about the plants that can be grown in summer. I had also given some tips and hacks to maintain the soil temperature during the summer season. Here is one such season, the Monsoon. Monsoon is one amazing season where the wind in the Indian Ocean and southern Asia blows from the southwest from April to October. The monsoon rejuvenates many beautiful plants. It is the transition time where the hot summer is dominated by the cool breeze and rain. So why don't you try growing some vegetable plants during this monsoon?\n1. Cucumber:\n\nImage source\n\na. Plant category: Vegetable.b. Germination time: 15 to 20 days.c. The temperature required: minimum 21°C.d. Harvest time: 90 days from germination.\n\nCucumber is one of the most popular and most used vegetables that can be consumed raw as well as cooked. They are called as kamal kakdi (Hindi), sowthekayi (Kannada) and has a lot more local names. Consuming cucumbers fights against inflammation manages stress, reduces cholesterol etc. Cucumbers are climber/creeper plants can be grown in containers as well as in your garden patch which requires good care in the process of growth. \n\nImage source\n \nCucumber can be easily grown from Cucumber seeds. They require 15 to 20 days to germinate under optimal conditions. The temperature should be at least 21°c so that the seeds can germinate well. They prefer wet soil to grow. Hence maintaining the moisture of the soil is very important. Plants require good soil for healthy growth. Well-drained potting mix helps the plant to grow well and absorb sufficient moisture. A potting mix containing cocopeat helps in retaining moisture content for a quite long period as cucumbers might lack water content. In summer water two days once depending on the plant and in winter water four days once in case of rain watering is most probably not required as the water flows directly into the plant well depending on the plant water four days once in case the plant gets dried up.\n\nImage source Beetles, Whiteflies, Aphids and Spider mites are the common pests that cause diseases to Cucumber. Use natural pesticides like “Neem oil”. Cucumbers from the day of sowing approximately 90 days fruits will be of 6-8 inches in height and green in color then they are ready for harvest. While removing be careful avoiding plant damage as they re-grow. Cut off the fruits with pruning secateurs or by a knife.\n \n2. Carrot:\n\nImage source\n\na. Plant category: Vegetable.b. Germination time: 15 to 20 days.c. The temperature required: 12°C to 26°C.d. Harvest time: 60 to 75 days from germination.\n\nCarrot is a common vegetable used to prepare most of the delicious cuisines. It can be eaten both raw or cooked. It is basically the root part of the plant. Carrots help improve eyesight, prevents cancer, promotes healthier skin, prevents heart disease, protects teeth and gums. As the carrots are root vegetables they need the pots of about 12-18 inches deep to grow. You can even use grow bags which even has a drainage hole at the bottom. In the case of land, choose a place where the plant gets sufficient sunlight and space to grow.\n\nImage sourceSelect good quality carrot seeds to grow the plants. It takes about 15 to 20 days to germinate from the seeds. Carrot plants grow in loose soil as their roots grow downwards. Use cocopeat based potting mix so that the roots can grow freely inside the soil. It requires 12°C to 26­­°C temperature to grow well. Carrots are cool weather crop. So it takes more water to grow. If you are providing proper water it will grow soon. Water the plants daily once during summer, once in two days during winter and only if required during the rainy season. The carrots are commonly affected by Aster yellows and Rhizoctonia diseases. Use organic pesticides like Neem oil instead of chemical pesticides.\n\nImage sourceCarrots are ready for harvest within 2 to 3 months from the day of sowing. Most carrots are ready to harvest when the shoulders are 1/2 to 3/4 inch in diameter, but again, there is much variation depending on the variety. Remove the plant by headgear safely as it cannot regrow again. As tender roots are sweeter and crunchy.\n3. Bitter Gourd:\n\nImage source\n\na. Plant category: Vegetable.b. Germination time: 20 to 25 days.c. The temperature required: minimum 21°C.d. Harvest time: 150 to 180 days from germination.\n\nBitter gourds are also called as Bitter melon, karela in Hindi, Hagalakayi in Kannada and different names in different languages is a popular creeper/climber vegetable plant in India used for cooking and also known for its bitterness but holds medicinal values. They have been in use for a very long time in or Ayurveda. Bitter gourd has been used in various Asian and African herbal medicine systems for a long time. It has been used as a folk remedy for a variety of ailments, particularly stomach complaints. In traditional medicine of India, different parts of the plant are used as claimed treatments for diabetes as it contains Polypeptide-p, an insulin analog. It is also used as a stomachic, laxative, antibilious, emetic, anthelmintic agent, for the treatment of cough, respiratory diseases, skin diseases, wounds, ulcer, gout, and rheumatism.\n\nImage sourceBitter gourds can be easily grown at home using seeds. They take 20 to 25 days to germinate. You can grow them either in pots or directly on the ground. But make sure to provide the good potting mix. Use a well-drained potting mix to avoid moisture accumulation at the roots and hence causing root rot. They require minimum 21°C to grow. We can grow Bitter gourd either indoor or in the outdoors. But it requires nearly six hours of sunlight every day. So it is better to grow them outdoors. Bitter gourd is a low water consumer plant. It does not take more water to grow. So, in summer, water them two times per week. In winter, watering three days once would be sufficient.Most of the times watering is not required during the rainy season. Water only if it does not rain for 4 days in a row.\n\nImage sourceThe common diseases that affect Bitter gourd are Powdery mildew and Downy mildew. Pests like mites, aphids, beetles, fruit flies and caterpillars are also responsible for the diseases. In order to help the plant grow healthy, use natural pesticides like Neem oil. Mix 20 to 50 ml of neem oil into one liter of water and spray on the plants. This can prevent most of the plant diseases. Bitter gourd will be ready for harvest after 150 to 180 days from the day of sowing. Cut off or pluck the fruits when they are about 10-15 cm. It's good you pluck them when they are tender as over ripen gourds may taste more bitter. Approximately a single healthy plant produces minimum 12-14 fruits.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "As we all know, plants are the major source of food. We get almost all the ingredients that we use for food from plants. Some have to be cooked before consuming and some can be consumed raw. Fruits belong to the category of food that can be consumed raw. Fruits are the most delicious part of the plant. They can satisfy your hunger within no time. They can also provide essential vital nutrients to the body. These things we all know. But did you know that some fruits are capable of preventing diseases? In the previous blog I had given the information about the plants that can prevent health hazards. Today let us know about the fruits.Yes. Here are 2 apples which are capable of preventing common diseases, Apple and Pineapple.\n1. Apple:\n\nImage sourceApples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe. They were first grown in Turkey and are considered to be perhaps the earliest tree to be cultivated by humans.As an old Proverb says \" An apple a day, keeps the doctor away\", Apple can prevent many health-related problems. The nutrition benefits of Apple include the ability to improve your digestion, improve heart health and help you better manage your weight. Since many phytonutrients are present in apple pulp and skin, studies have proved the consumption of apples with a reduced risk of certain forms of cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, Alzheimer’s disease and even diabetes. Apples are ranked second among all types of fruit for their total concentration of phenolic compounds which comes under the class of bioactive substances that includes flavonoids.\n \n\nImage sourceApples are also said to be responsible for the prevention of prostate cancer because of a substance produced in it called quercetin. High fiber found in apple can decrease the risk of heart attacks by decreasing the cholesterol rate. The fiber found in apples, called pectin has the ability to lower cholesterol levels naturally. They’re one of the best natural sources of boron, a mineral that is important for building strong bones and helping to prevent osteoporosis. Boron uses and benefits include help in building muscle mass and supporting brain function. Some evidence also shows that low boron intake might be associated with fatigue, arthritis and mood changes.\n \n\nImage source \nAn apple supplies about 14% of your daily vitamin C, which is considered a powerful antioxidant which is important for skin, eye, immune and brain health. This vitamin C is capable of avoiding free radical damage and helps protect DNA and cells from mutation and malformation. \n \n2. Pineapple:\n\nImage sourcePineapple has a long history of use in places, including Hawaii, South America and Asia. Pineapple is a South American native which is used as part of Hawaiian folk medicine, is one of the richest sources in the world of the enzyme bromelain. It is composed of several endopeptidases and compounds like phosphatase, glucosidase, peroxidase, cellulase, escharase and protease inhibitors. As per Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine, Bromelain was first isolated from pineapple juice in 1891 and introduced as a therapeutic supplement in 1957. This compound has traditionally been used as a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-swelling agent.\n \n\nImage sourcePineapple supports heart health because of its fiber, potassium and vitamin C content. One study found that one of the benefits of pineapple juice if that it has cardio-protective abilities, as seen in studies done on rats. The study concluded that pineapple juice can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and can help establish digestion and absorption. High potassium intakes are also associated with a reduced risk of stroke, protection against loss of muscle mass, preservation of bone mineral density and reduction in the formation of kidney stones.\n \n\nImage sourceThe beta-carotene present in pineapple helps to lower the risk of developing asthma. Toxins, poor nutrition, pollution, antibiotic abuse and stress play a large role in the development of asthma. The inflammation caused by the toxins and poor nutrition can be reduced by pineapple's detoxifying capabilities. The enzymes present in pineapple have selective cytotoxicity and they are able to kill cancer-causing cells by the process called apoptosis but does not affect healthy cells. Additionally, recent studies have shown that bromelain from pineapple helps stop lung metastasis in its tracks and hence bromelain can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases. It can also help soothe and relax tense, inflamed muscles and connective tissues. So it is commonly used as a meat tenderizer.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Decorating your household with beautiful and attractive indoor plant enhance the ambiance of the house. Everyone loves to present their home attractive by growing indoor plants. Some people have potted plants at their home. They grow plants in big flower pots made out of ceramic and terracotta. It is not a bad idea when it comes to outdoor gardening. But you cannot have such big pots for plants at indoors to decorate your household. These pots can fit only outdoors. What if the plants are placed in transparent containers? Having such containers with breathtaking designs increases your dignity in your neighborhood. Yes, you can decorate your household with Terrarium containers. Just imagine having such cute and small flower pots on your work table or study table. These tabletop planters help us breathe pollution free and fresh air. These small flower pots keep you refreshed and will bring you out from all external pressures. These decorative pots create an ambiance around you and keep you enthusiastic. Let us know about Terrariums.\n \nWhat is a Terrarium?\n\nImage sourceA Terrarium is a designer glass container in which plants can be grown. It can be opened for maintenance to access the plants inside. Terrariums are often kept as decorative or ornamental items. Closed terrariums create a unique environment for plant growth, as the transparent walls allow for both heat and light to enter the terrarium. When choosing a container, remember that closed containers hold more humidity and create more humid atmosphere. Open containers are ideal for cactus and succulent gardens, as well as other plants that prefer less humidity. Clear, smooth glass offers the best view of the plants.\n \n\nThe sealed container allows the heat to enter the terrarium for creating a small scale water cycle. This happens as the moisture from both soil and plants evaporates in the elevated temperatures inside the terrarium. The water vapor then condenses on the walls of the container and falls back to the plants and soil below. This helps in creating an ideal environment for growing plants due to the constant supply of water, thereby preventing the plants from becoming over dry. The light that passes through the transparent material of the terrarium allows the plants to carry out photosynthesis, which helps in the plant growth.\n \nTerrarium Culture:\n\nImage sourceTerrarium culture was first started in the year 1842. A botanist named Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward was the first person to start this culture. He was observing the insects behavior and accidentally left some ferns inside a glass jar. A few days later, it germinated and started to grow. This is how the first Terrarium was made. This became famous during the time of Queen Victoria. It was then called as Wardian case, named after its inventor and the botanist Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward himself.\n\nImage source\nAccording to a story, Ward ordered the carpenters to make Wardian cases and exported native British plants to Sydney, Australia. After months of travel, the plants arrived well in good condition. Similarly, plants from Australia were sent to London using the same method and he received his Australian plants in perfect condition. His experiment indicated that plants can be sealed in without ventilation and the plants can survive.\n \nTypes of Terrariums:\nAccording to the conditions required for different plants, terrariums are classified into two types namely Open Terrariums and Closed Terrariums.\n1. Closed Terrariums:\n\nImage sourcePlants like Orchids, Mosses, Ferns etc., which grow in tropical regions requires a humid environment. So these plants are kept in Closed Terrariums. As these terrariums are sealed, they provide optimal conditions for such plants to grow. But you must open the Terrariums once in a week to remove excess moisture from the air and walls of the container. This also avoids the growth of molds which can harm the plants. Closed terraria also require a special soil mix to ensure both good growing conditions and to reduce the risks of microbial damage.\n\n2. Open Terrariums:\n\nOpen Terrariums are used to grow dry plants like Succulents. These plants won't require much moisture. Hence they can be easily grown in an Open Terrarium. The plants that require more direct sunlight can be easily grown in open terrariums, as closed terrariums can trap too much heat potentially killing any plants inside.\n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

Nature is the most beautiful creation in this world. The word 'Nature' gives us a relaxed feeling irrespective of any sort of tensions. Plants are commonly grown for home garden designing, positive psychological effects and for indoor air purification. Plants used in this fashion are most commonly tropical or semi-tropical type.\nIn our previous blogs, we had mentioned about Terrace Gardening ideas and Vertical Gardening ideas. Apart from them you might have tried many gardening techniques to make your garden look attractive and may have succeeded to some extent. If you have got sufficient space around your house to grow many plants, here is one amazing way of presenting your garden beautifully. This amazing technique is called Topiary, the art of bringing plants alive.\n \nWhat is Topiary?\n\nImage source\nTopiary is an art of training perennial plants by pruning the foliage and twigs of trees, shrubs and subshrubs in order to give clearly defined shapes. As an art form, it is a type of living sculpture. The word 'Topiary' is derived from the Latin word 'topiarius' which means ornamental landscape gardening. Most of the plants used in topiary are evergreen and woody plants which contains small leaves with dense and bushy foliage. These densely growing leaves help in creating such amazing designs in the garden. This technique not only helps in beautifying the garden but also help in the healthy growth of plants. Regular pruning of plants can remove the unwanted foliages from the plants. This also helps in preventing disease-causing pathogens affecting the plants.\nTopiary Designs\n\nImage sourceMost of the topiary designs imitate the birds, animals and humans. Apart from these designs attractive patterns like cubes, spheres, house etc., are also made. Here are some of the types in topiary gardens.\n \n1. Parterres Garden:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nA parterre is a formal garden constructed on a level substrate, consisting of plant beds, typically in symmetrical patterns, which are separated and connected by paths. These gardens have simple, large, clipped specimens in and among statues. They also contain beautiful ornate, clipped box hedges swirling around them in mirrored patterns or geometric designs. This style of hedging is known as a parterre garden.In earlier parterre gardens the gaps in the patterns would be left open and the ground would be covered with ornamental Pebbles. As time went on, the style changed and other plants were added to give extra color and interest.\n \n2. Maze Garden or Labyrinths Garden:\n\nImage source\n\nImage sourceThe Maze Garden or Labyrinths Garden are designed using vertical hedges as a wall or dividers between passages. The plants are grown in a straight line pattern and cropped as per the design. The Normans introduced pleasure gardens with mazes and labyrinths formed from clipped plants. Many public gardens still have such designs even today.\n \n3. Knot garden or Overlapped garden:\n\nImage source\n\nImage sourceThis type of topiary garden is designed using overlapping patterns. This was first introduced in England during the time of Queen Elizabeth I. Topiary gardens became very popular in Great Britain in her time. During this period, knot gardens and clipped ornate shapes were introduced to gardens throughout the country. The knot garden was formed from different colored boxes, planted in crisscrossing patterns so that it appeared as though ribbons were tied up in knots. Highly-scented herbs were also used as hedging plants among the gaps to give a tapestry of color.\n \nMost common Topiary shapes:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\n\nImage sourceTopiary is still found in many modern gardens with some contemporary designs. You cannot use any plant to create a topiary garden. There are a certain variety of plants which make the topiary garden a masterpiece. Some of the common plants grown in the topiary garden are Duranta Plant, Bougainvillea, English Ivy, Alternanthera Plant etc.,\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Gardening is one of the trending hobbies these days. Many people are showing interests towards gardening. They are curious to know the basics and technical aspects of gardening. In our previous blogs, we had discussed Super easy hacks to germinate seeds, Easy Gardening tips for Beginners, common plant diseases like Root Rot, Leaf Blight, Powdery Mildew, Bacterial Canker and Aphids. These details were enough till the plants grow upto certain stage. The growth of plants depends on certain factors like Composting, Nutrients and Sunlight. So today I'm here to discuss the importance of light for the growth of plants.\n \n\nImage source\nFor any plant to grow, you need to provide favorable conditions so that they grow well. As we all know sunlight is essential for a plant to grow well. Sunlight is very important for the plants to carry out the Photosynthesis process. They prepare their own food using the sunlight.\nWhat is Photosynthesis?\n\nImage sourcePhotosynthesis is a process used by plants in which energy from sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into molecules needed for growth. These molecules include sugars, enzymes and chlorophyll. Light energy is absorbed by the green chemical pigment called chlorophyll. This chlorophyll is responsible for the Photosynthetic process. The whole process takes place through tiny pores called Stomata.\n \nWhat are stomata?\n\nImage sourceStomata are the tiny pores present on the leaves which helps in gas exchange. Plants also breathe, but they do it through these tiny openings in leaves called stomata. Stomata open and close to allow the intake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen. They are mostly found on the under-surface of plant leaves. Air enters the plant through these openings and the carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis.\n \n\nImage sourcePlants and other photosynthetic organisms can collect solar energy to carryout Photosynthesis. They have photosensitive cells on their leaves which stimulates the process. The dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency upon the light environment originates from the existence of a number of limiting factors, restricting the rate of light energy consumption. As a result of evolution under frequent exposure to low light fluxes, the photosynthetic machinery has evolved in such a way that only a small fraction of chlorophyll molecules are actually photosynthetically effective. The light falling on the plants is directly proportional to the healthy growth of plants and hence gives a good yield. The plants are categorized into three different types based on the light requirement. \n1. Low light plants or Shade Plants:\n\n                                     Example - Lucky Bamboo\nThese plants are mostly indoor plants. They do not require much sunlight to grow. They can carry out the photosynthesis even with minimum sunlight or artificial light. Some of the examples of Low light plants are Peace Lily, Sansevieria, Money Plant, Syngonium, Lucky Bamboo etc.,Plants that can be grown in less sunlight\n\n2. Partial Sunlight Plants:\n\nImage source           Example - Coriander Plant\nThese plants can be grown both indoor as well as outdoor. They require a good sunlight to grow. But if the sunlight is high, they cannot sustain and hence perish. Some of the examples of Partial sunlight plants are Coriander, Capsicum, Antirrhinum etc.,\n\n3. High or Full Sunlight Plants:\n\nImage source        Example - Portulaca Plant\nThese are hardy plants which are capable of withstanding the high sunlight. Most of these plants are outdoor plants. They require plenty of sunlight for their growth. So if they are grown in shade, they perish. Some of the examples are Portulaca, Cosmos, Aster etc.,\nThere are some Parasitic plants which are capable of carrying out photosynthesis. But they depend on other plants for nutrients. These plants are called Hemiparasites. Parasites- Plants which depend on other plants for food\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Hello garden enthusiasts, today I'm back with an interesting topic. Before starting the topic let me ask you a simple question. \nWhat are the essential components required for growing a plant?\nYes. You are right. We need seeds, soil, pots or land to grow, water and fertilizers. These are the basic physical components we need for growing a plant. We sow the seeds in the soil, pour water and add fertilizers to the soil. Within few days the seeds germinate and start to grow. This process goes on and the plants start to yield. We all know this process. But did you know that we can grow plants without soil?Confused? You heard it right. You can grow plants without soil. This technique is called Aeroponics. So today I'm going to tell you about Aeroponics.\n \nWhat is aeroponics?\n\nImage source\nAeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or moist environment without the use of soil or other growing media. The word Aeroponics has derived from Greek words where Aero means 'Air' and ponos means 'Growth'. This technique was first introduced in 1911 by a botanist called V.M.Artsikhovski. He designed the first aeroponics and in practice showed about plant cultivation without soil. He published an article in a famous agricultural journal 'Experienced Agronomy' about 'Air Plant Cultures', where he had explained about the method of physiological studies of root systems by spraying various substances in the surrounding air. This is the basic concept for the Aeroponics method.\n \nHow does Aeroponics work?\n\nImage sourceThe basic concept of aeroponics is to grow plants suspended in a closed or semi-closed environment by spraying nutrient-rich water solution to the plant roots and lower part of the stem. The plants are suspended on a support structure where the leaves are placed above the structure and roots are suspended downwards. A foam is used as the support structure. It is compressed around the lower stem and inserted into an opening in the aeroponic chamber. As we are not growing the plants in the growing medium, the whole system is pest free when compared to that of other plants. But we cannot assure complete pest resistance as the system is not a closed one. Many aeroponic systems look very similar to traditional potted plant systems, with the main difference that the containers for the plants are sealed around the plants’ bases and have an almost closed environment for the root systems.\n \n\nImage source\nWith aeroponics, indoor horticulturists may use vertical and horizontal space to grow more plants using less floor space and they conserve water by using sealed aeroponic systems. Depending on the aeroponic system, nutrients may be sprayed manually at intervals throughout the day. But most of the aeroponic systems have one or more pumps that automatically keep plants nourished by spraying the nutrients without constant supervision. As long as the system is sealed and nutrient mist is consistently pumped to the roots, plants grow well in an aeroponic environment.\n \nAdvantages of Aeroponics\n\nImage source\n \n1. Exposure to air: An ideal aeroponic system provides minimal plant support features. Minimal contact between a plant and support structure allows the plant to be entirely in the air. Long-term aeroponic cultivation requires the root systems to be free from the intermediate system surrounding the stem and root systems. Physical contact is minimized so that it does not affect the natural growth and root expansion or access to pure water, air exchange and disease-free conditions.2. Good supply of Oxygen: Oxygen is very important for the healthy growth of plants. As the aeroponics method is conducted in the air combined with micro-droplets of nutrient-rich water, the plant can grow to easily in the air with an ample supply of oxygen, water and nutrients. Clean air contains oxygen which is an excellent purifier for plants and the aeroponic environment. For natural growth to occur, the plant must have good access to air. Plants must be allowed to grow in a natural manner for the successful growth. 3. Comparatively free from Diseases: As the system does not depend on any growing medium, the risk of plants getting prone to disease is less. Aeroponics can limit disease transmission since plant-to-plant contact is reduced and each spray pulse can be sterile. Most of the plant diseases are caused by the growing medium. Due to the disease-free environment in aeroponics, many plants can grow at higher density when compared to other forms of cultivation.\n \nTypes of Aeroponics:\n\nImage source\nThere are three types of aeroponic methods namely Low-Pressure Aeroponics, High-Pressure Aeroponics and Commercial Aeroponic Systems. 1. Low-Pressure Aeroponics:\nIn the low-pressure aeroponic systems, the plant roots are suspended above the layer containing the nutrient solution or inside a channel connected to the nutrient solution layer. A low-pressure pump sprays the nutrient solution via jets or small sprinklers which then drips or drains back into the nutrient solution layer. As the plants grow bigger in these units their roots lose the ability to absorb the adequate nutrients.\n2. High-Pressure Aeroponics:\nIn the High-pressure aeroponic system, the nutrients are sprayed by the high-pressure pumps. This technique is used in the cultivation of high value crops and plant specimens used for the study of horticulture.3. Commercial Aeroponic System:As the name itself suggests, this method is used for growing commercial crops. Commercial aeroponic systems are also used for the cultivation of high value crops where multiple crop rotations are achieved on an ongoing commercial basis. Commercial aeroponic systems comprise high-pressure systems and biological systems. The biological systems include intensifications for extended plant life and crop health. Biological systems include good controls systems, disease prevention &amp; pathogen resistance features to avoid diseases, nutrient solution pressurization system to spray the nutrient solution to the roots, heating and cooling sensors &amp; thermal control of solutions to maintain the required temperature, efficient photon-flux light arrays to provide required light etc., Whatever may be the complication, this can be a very good substitute for the conventional plant cultivation using soil.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Summer is the toughest season for both Plants and animals. They won't get sufficient water during this season. More than 40% of the plant perish every year due to lack of water. Due to global warming, all the water sources are evaporating hence causing water scarcity. But, I'm happy to tell you that despite hot climate, there are certain plants which can grow during the summer season. They can survive in high sunlight. Here are some of the plants which can grow in summer. I'm even more happy to tell you that the plants that I'm going to discuss are beautiful flowering plants. You can grow these plants during summer and enjoy their beauty.\n1. Portulaca:\n\na. Plant category: Flower.b. Germination time: 10 to 15 days.c. The temperature required: 18 °C to 21°C.d. Harvest time: 65 to 80 days from germination.\n\n\nImage source\nPortulaca is a succulent flowering plant found in Argentina, Brazil and South Asian countries. These plants produce flowers with attractive colors like Pink, Yellow, Red, white etc., They are often used as ornamental plants. They are commonly called as Rose moss, ten 'o'clock, Mexican rose, Sun rose etc.,\nYou can easily grow Portulaca plant from seeds at your home. Portulaca seeds take 10 to 15 days to germinate. Portulaca plant can be grown in any kinds of soil but prefer sandy, well-drained soil and love the full sunlight. They require minimum 18°c to 21°c for the better growth. These plants are excellent high heat and drought tolerant flowering plants. As they belong to the succulent category, they do not require regular watering. Light watering would be enough as their root zone is very shallow. Using an organic potting mix with good drainage facility will boost up the plant's growth. Add sufficient organic fertilizers to enrich the nutrients.\n\nImage sourceThis plant is most affected by pests like Aphids and gnats. We advice applying \"Neem oil\". Neem oil is a natural pesticide. So can avoid diseases. You can harvest the flowers after 65 to 80 days of germination. \n2. Aster:\n\na. Plant category: Flower.b. Germination time: 15 to 20 days.c. The temperature required: Minimum 18 °C.d. Harvest time: 45 to 60 days from germination.\n\n\nImage sourceAster is another ornamental plant grown at most of the houses. They are native to Europe, Asia and North American countries. The name 'Aster' is derived from the Greek language which means \"Star'. Because of its star-shaped flowers, they were called as 'Aster'. These flowers bloom in Purple, White, Red and other attractive colors. These flowers will enhance the beauty of your home garden. The aster seeds germinate within 15 to 20 days. They can be easily grown in pots. Aster seeds require minimum 18°c to germinate. Even though aster is a perennial plant which can be grown in any season, it can withstand hot weather. So no need to worry about high sunlight. Asters are the low water consumer plants. Weekly once in the summer season, three or four days once in the winter and rainy season would be sufficient. Make sure you are planting them in a good potting mix and providing good natural fertilizer.\n\nImage sourceAster is commonly affected by Powdery Mildew disease. Proper care must be taken by treating the plants with natural pesticides like Neem oil. Aster flowers will be ready for harvest after 45 to 60 days of germination.\n3. Cosmos\na. Plant category: Flower.b. Germination time: 10 to 15 days.c. The temperature required: minimum 21 degrees C.d. Harvest time: 60 to 70 days from germination.\n\nImage Source\nCosmos is one of the easiest growing flower plants at home. The colorful flowers of this plant have the ability to catch the attention. It can be grown in any season but grows well in summer. \nThe seeds will take about 10 to 15 days to germinate. You can germinate the seeds in pots or directly on the land. We suggest germinating the seeds in the seedling tray for effective germination as seedling tray method is the safest method for germination. Once the saplings reach 2 to 3 inches height, you can transplant them to the bigger pots or directly to the land. It requires minimum 21°c to grow well. A good potting mix containing essential nutrients is required for the saplings to grow well. I suggest using organic fertilizers in order to keep the plant healthy. As cosmos is a summer plant, it cannot sustain less sunlight. So it is better to grow the plant outdoors.\n\nImage sourceCosmos is a high water consumer plant. During winter water the plants once in 2 days and do not water during rainy season unless the plant is not getting the rainwater. Canker and Powdery Mildew are the common diseases that can affect the cosmos plant. So use Neem oil which protects the plant and acts as an organic pesticide. They are harvested after 60 to 70 days of germination. \n4. Cockscomb:\n\na. Plant category: Flower.b. Germination time: 10 to 15 days.c. The temperature required: Minimum 20°C to 26°C.d. Harvest time: 80 to 95 days from germination.\n\n\nImage sourceCockscomb is a decorative flower plant which is used to decorate the house. As the flower looks like the head of a rooster or cock, this flower is called as Cockscomb. These plants are resistant to most diseases and can be grown both indoors and outdoors. The plant prefers well-drained soil, as the plant is susceptible to fungal diseases. These flowers also bloom in attractive colors and beautify your house.\nImage source\nCockscomb seeds take 10 to 15 days to germinate. You can either grow them in pots or directly in the land. Growing Cockscomb in a well-drained potting soil will make the plant healthy. It requires 20°c to 26°c. It needs water in time to grow healthy. Watering the plants three to four days once during winter &amp; rainy season and to 6 days once in the summer season would be enough for the healthy growth of the plant.\nCockscomb plants are affected by diseases like Bacterial Leaf spot and Root rot. By using suitable natural pesticides like Neem oil, these diseases. Cockscombs can be harvested after 80 to 95 days of germination.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Plants are those little ones which have the capacity to refresh your mood within no time. Spending some time with your lovely plants can make you stress free irrespective of any tensions. Generally, people grow plants in two ways. They either get some plants from the local nursery and grow them in their place or get the plant seeds from the nearest gardening stores or nurseries and start their gardening journey. Maintaining a plant bought from a nursery is not a big deal when compared to growing plants from seeds. Did you know there is another way to grow plants?Yes, you guessed it right. It is from Bulbs. Growing plant from the bulb is also one way to have a beautiful garden. You might be wondering what is a bulb?\n \nWhat is a Bulb?\n\nImage source\nA bulb is a specialized part of a plant which is structurally a short stem with fleshy leaves or leaf bases that function as food storage organs during dormancy. A bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. You find an unexpanded flowering shoot at the center of the bulb which is a vegetative growing point. The base is formed by a reduced stem, and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. The roots develop from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. Plants which contains underground bulbs are called bulbous plants. Most of the beautiful flowers can be grown from bulbs. \nHow to use the bulbs?\n\nImage source\nIn the similar way you use the seeds, sow the bulbs in the soil and water it. Provide essential nutrients by adding fertilizers and compost. Sow the bulbs in 4 inches to 8 inches deep according to the size of the bulb. Growing them in the soil with good drainage system is very important. If the soil does not have a good drainage system, there are chances of bulbs getting rotten which leads to the Root rot disease.\n \n\nImage source\nIt is not a bad idea to grow the bulbs in the pots. But you need to sow the bulb such that the tip or crown of the bulb is just above the soil. Choosing the pots of 8 inches to 12 inches would be a good option to grow these bulbs. You need to keep the pots in a dark place or shady place in order to encourage the growth. \n \nSteps to grow plants from bulbs:\n\n \n\nChoose a potting mix with a good drainage system.\nDig a hole approximately 3 times deeper than the bulb.\nPlace the bulb inside the hole and close it with the soil.\nProvide sufficient water and essential nutrients for the plants to grow healthy.\n\n\n \n\nThere are five types of bulbs.\n1. True bulbs: These are the specialized part of a plant which serves as the food storage units during dormancy. 2. Tubers: Tubers are the thickened underground part of a stem which serves as a food reserve and bearing buds from which new plants arise.3. Corms: Corms are rounded underground storage organ present in plants consisting of a swollen stem base covered with scale leaves.4. Rhizomes: Rhizomes are horizontally growing underground stem which puts out lateral shoots and roots at intervals.5. Tuberous roots: The tuberous root differs from other root structures by the nutrient reserves being stored in an actual root instead of an enlarged stem.\n \nCommon flower bulbs\n      \n      \n     \nThe common plants grown using these bulbs are Gladiolus, Rajnigandha, Daylily, Football Lily, Zephyranthes etc., These are the common ornamental plants that produce beautiful flowers.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Living in an atmosphere with greenery everywhere gives pleasure to the body as well as to the soul. This greenery symbolizes peacefulness. The word 'Plants' brings a beautiful scenery in our mind. In the ancient times, people lived in the forest where they use to nurture different kind of plants around their place. They were worshiping nature as God. They were spending their time in growing different kind of plants. Some of the plants were toxic and caused health hazards. Despite knowing about the toxic property of such plants, they used to consume them and fall sick. Gradually they came to know about toxic plants and stayed away from them. Today let us discuss about some most of the dangerous plants found across the world. Most of them are seen in dense forests but some are unknowingly grown as decorative plants at home. \n \n1. Dieffenbachia or Dumb canes:\n\nImage source\n\n \nImage source\nDieffenbachia or commonly called as the Dumb cane is one of the common houseplant grown for decorative purpose. Dieffenbachia is a perennial plant with a straight stem and big leaves containing white spots. It is native to the New World Tropics from Mexico and the West Indies south to Argentina. Some species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants and have become naturalized on a few tropical islands. The white spots on the plants make it attractive as an indoor plant. The Dieffenbachia plant contains small needle-shaped calcium oxalate crystals called raphides. These crystals can cause a temporary burning sensation in the mouth, throat and irritation if consumed. If prolonged contact is made with the throat, it causes severe swelling and affects breathing. In some cases the tissues become so swollen that the airways are blocked, leading to death. \n \n2. Hippomane Mancinella or Manchineel:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nHippomane Mancinella or Manchineel is considered as one of the poisonous trees in the world. Each and every part of the tree, from the root to the leaf contains toxins. It is found in tropical southern North America and South America. It is also called as 'Manzanilla de la Muerte' which means 'The Apple of death' in the Spanish language. The liquid secreted from the tree causes allergic reactions and blisters on the skin. If the wood of this tree is burned, it produces toxic fumes which cause respiratory problems. It may be fatal with continuous inhalation and if the smoke reaches the eyes, it causes blindness. Consumption of the leaves may also be fatal and cause death. Its fruits taste sweet at first and start burning the mouth and throat gradually causing death. \n3. Cicuta maculata or Poison Hemlock\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nCicuta maculata or Poison Hemlock is the extremely poisonous plant in the world. it is said to be the reason for the death of famous philosopher Socrates. In ancient Greece, the philosopher Socrates died in 399 BC after drinking a potion solution of poison hemlock. Water hemlock contains a deadly toxin, especially in its roots, and will rapidly generate potentially fatal symptoms if consumed. This species of poisonous plant is found in all parts of North America, from northern Canada to southern Mexico. Cicuta causes violent and painful convulsions and becomes fatal when swallowed. It may cause death within 15 minutes of consumption. Hence hemlock is considered to be North America's most toxic plant. Painful convulsions, abdominal cramps, nausea, and death are common causes found after eating this plant. Those who survive are often afflicted with amnesia or lasting tremors.\n \n4. Ricinus communis or Castor Beans\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nRicinus communis or Castor Beans is a common plant which we see around us. They naturally contain the poison ricin and are deadly. Just two seeds would be enough to kill a child and up to eight to kill an adult. The castor oil is used to aid in digestion although the harmful compound called ricin is removed from the beans before making oil. Ricin inhibits the synthesis of proteins within cells and can cause severe vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and even death. Its leaves resemble Papaya leaves so it is confused to be Papaya plant. Castor bean seeds have thorn-like structures on their body which differentiate them from Papaya plant. These plants are grown as ornamental plants in southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions.\nDisclaimer: Our intention was to create awareness in our readers and not to create any negative impact on the readers.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Plants are the major source of food for any living being. It directly or indirectly serves as the source of food. Each plant has unique characteristic nutrients. We eat greens, vegetables and fruits which are extracted from the plants everyday to satisfy our hunger. But did you know that they not only satisfy your hunger but also keep you healthy? In ancient times, people used plants to cure themselves of deadly diseases. Plants have the ability to boost the immunity. The most popular method of treatment and also India's pride, 'Ayurveda' is based on plants. Here are some of the medicinal plants which have the ability to fight against health hazards.\n \n1. Garlic:\n\nImage source\nGarlic is one of the common ingredients in almost all the Indian cuisine. It has the ability to make the food more delicious. Garlic is particularly high in certain sulfur compounds that are believed to be responsible for its scent and taste, as well as its very positive effects on human health. Eating garlic regularly can prevent four of the major causes of death including heart disease, stroke, cancer and infections.\n\nImage source\nToday, heart diseases are the main reason for death. Garlic has been widely recognized as both a preventative agent and treatment of many cardiovascular diseases. Its bioactive sulfur compounds are said to be effective at each stage of cancer formation and help many biological processes that modify cancer risk. National Cancer Institute recognizes garlic as one of several vegetables with potential anticancer properties. It can also help in maintaining the blood pressure of your body.\n \n2. Tulsi or Holy Basil:\n\nImage sourceHoly Basil or popularly known as Tulsi is a mandatory plant in every Indian household. Tulsi has been given a great importance in Ayurveda. Holy basil leaves are now regarded by most countries as adaptogens or Anti-stress agents. This medicinal plant has the ability to control blood glucose levels. So it is one of the best medicine for Diabetes. Researchers have proved that the impact of the tulsi plant can improve the immune system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastric system, and urinary system.\n\nImage source\nIts leaves consumed with honey will cure all stomach related problems. It is boiled in water and consumed to cure cough and throat infections. Research shows that people who regularly consume tulsi have good immunity and are less likely to be susceptible to developing cancer cells.

Aloe vera juice helps in digestion by normalizing acid, alkaline and pH balance, lessens yeast formation and encourages digestive bacterias.\n\nImage sourceThe enzymes present in this medicinal plant break down the proteins in our food into amino acids and provide the converted proteins to every cell in the body, which enables the cells to function properly. Aloe vera stimulates the immune system of our body and helps to kill infections. Aloe Vera juice can also be used as a cure for Diabetes. The antioxidant properties of aloe vera are also helpful in protecting the skin from skin cancer and fight skin inflammation after exposure to the sun. Aloe vera can also naturally treat acne and eczema since it helps the healing process in the skin.\n \nGinger:\n\nImage sourceGinger is one of the most used spices in Indian Cuisines. It has the ability to make the food delicious by its characteristic taste. Ginger is a flowering plant that belongs to turmeric and cardamom family. The underground stem or rhizome of the ginger plant is commonly known as the ginger root and is well-known for its medicinal properties. Ginger contains many important vitamins and minerals in it. It also contains gingerol, a compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can lead to many unique health benefits.\n\nImage source\nGinger is well-known for its ability to treat nausea, a sensation of unease and discomfort in the upper stomach. Stomach ulcers which are painful sores that form in the lining of the stomach and cause symptoms like indigestion, fatigue, heartburn and abdominal discomfort can be cured by ginger. One of the most impressive benefits of ginger is its anti-cancer properties. The presence of a powerful compound called 6-gingerol is responsible for blocking cancer cell growth and development for ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Everyone loves to have a beautiful garden in their place. Having beautiful plants with colorful flowers and delicious fruits in your garden makes your home look like heaven. But when it comes to the maintenance, most of us lack in knowledge. For any plant to grow, you need to provide favorable conditions so that they grow well. As we all know sunlight is essential for a plant to grow well. Sunlight is very important for the plants to carry out the Photosynthesis process. They prepare their own food using the sunlight. But there are certain plants which can survive with less sunlight. They utilize the artificial light source available indoors and can carry out the photosynthesis process. Plants have photosensitive cells on their leaves which stimulates the process and hence providing the light artificially will also work. But keep in mind, not all plants can survive in such atmosphere. Here are some of the plants which can survive with less sunlight. \n \n1. Spathiphyllum or Peace Lily:\n\nImage sourceSpathiphyllum or Peace Lily is one such cute plant which is grown as a decorative plant in most of the household. It belongs to the monocotyledonous flowering plant's category. These plants are widely grown in tropical regions of the America and southeastern Asia. This plant produces beautiful white flowers with a single petal covering the pollens. These plants not only brighten up a living space but also purifies the air around it. Peace lilies are capable of growing in less sunlight. So it is mostly used as an indoor plant. They cannot tolerate overwatering. So you need not water it every now and then. Watering once in a week would be enough for water Lily to grow well. Overwatering is one of the most common reasons for a peace lily to die. This plant does not require frequent fertilizing. If you are adding the fertilizers two times per year, that would be enough to keep the plant healthy.\n \n2. Sansevieria or Mother in Law's Tongue\n\nImage sourceSansevieria is one of the best indoor plants to grow. It is a succulent plant native to Africa, Madagascar and Southern Asia. It is commonly known as Mother in law's tongue plant or snake plant. It has long and thick leaves which is hard to prune. This can also be the defense mechanism of the plant to prevent the animals from eating them. It is a cute little plant which can be grown indoors. It can even grow in low light conditions and with less water. It is popular as a houseplant as it can survive in less sunlight and irregular watering. If you water the plant once in 2 months, that would be enough for the plant to grow well. But keep in mind, it cannot tolerate overwatering and will rot easily if overwatered. It is a non-toxic plant so no need to worry about the health hazards on your children and pets. It is not only a good air purifier but also has the ability to eliminate bad odor from its surroundings. \n \n3. Devil's Ivy or Money Plant\n\nImage source Devil's Ivy or commonly called as Money Plant is one of the common climbers which we come across in every household. It is native to tropical and subtropical forests of Australia, Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan etc., This plant can survive in any extreme conditions. It does not require much water to grow. If you water the plant once in a week, that would be enough for the plant to grow healthy. As it can grow in less sunlight, it is often grown as an indoor plant. It is called as Devil's Ivy because it is almost impossible to kill this plant as it can grow in any conditions. There is no extra care required to grow this plant. If you provide fertilizers once in a year, that would be enough. Apart from being a drought-resistant plant, it can also purify the air around it. NASA has declared it as one of the best air purifying plants. It can also eliminate formaldehyde, xylene and other impurities from the air.\n \n \n4. Anthurium or Lace leaf:\n\nImage sourceAnthurium or Lace leaf is one of the indoor plants which is grown as a decorative plant. The Red colored leaf-like petals with a yellow colored inflorescence make it more attractive. For this amazing beauty, people often grow this plant to decorate their household. This plant cannot tolerate direct light as this can burn the leaves. But it grows well in bright, indirect light. So it is preferred to be grown indoors. This species of plant is native to northern Mexico, northern Argentina and some parts of the Caribbean. It also has the ability to purify the air around the plant. Anthurium has a very long blooming shelf life. So this plant stands unique with other flowering plants. This plant is more often prone to Root Rot. So do not overwater the plants. \n \n5. Philodendron:\n\nImage sourcePhilodendron is a flowering plant which is often grown as a decorative plant at indoors. The name 'Philodendron' has derived from Greek words 'Philo' which means Love or affection and 'dendron' means tree. This amazing plant is native to Brazilian rain forests. The philodendron has many varieties of plants, including many species and cultivars in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. Some of them are Lacy Tree Philodendron, Heartleaf Philodendron, etc., Lacy Tree Philodendron, also known as split-leaf philodendron has half-lobed leaves which makes it attractive and hence grown as a decorative plant. Heartleaf Philodendron is a popular climber with heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The leaves are about two to four inches long. This is the common variety which is used as an ornamental plant. It is also known as the sweetheart plant which can grow in very low sunlight. It is one of the most dependable and toughest of all houseplants. \n \n6.

        "articleBody": "We come across many kinds of plants around us. In the earlier blogs, we have discussed about Plants which are hard to kill, Plants with Unusual looking flowers, Plants which survive with less water and Carnivorous plants which feed on the insects. Here is another category of plants which feed on other plants for food. Yes, you read it right. This category of plants is called Parasitic Plants. They depend on the neighboring plants for their survival. They possess modified roots, called haustoria, which penetrate undetected into the vascular system of their host and absorb the nutrients required for their growth. Parasitic plants are categorized according to the type of attachment in has with the host plant. \n \n Types of Parasitic Plants\n \n1. Dependability on the host plant.\n\nIf the parasitic plants totally depends on the host, then they are called Obligate parasites. If the parasitic plants are capable of living independently in the absence of the host plant, they are called Facultative parasites. \n\n2. Production of chlorophyll.\n\nIf the parasitic plants are capable of producing chlorophyll by themselves but depends on the host plant for some amount of nutrition, they are called Hemiparasites.If the parasitic plants are pale yellow or not capable of producing chlorophyll and depend totally on the host plants is called Holoparasite.\n\n3. On the position of the Parasite.\n\nIf the parasitic plants are found attached to the host from inside, they are called Endoparasites.If the parasitic plants is attached to the host externally, they are called Exoparasites. \n\nHere are some of the Parasitic Plants\n\n1. Rafflesia Arnoldii:\n\nImage source\nRafflesia Arnoldii, world's biggest flower also has another grade to its cap. It is not only the biggest flower in the world but also a parasitic plant. Rafflesia is grown in the forests of Indonesia and Southeast Asia. It does not develop stems, leaves, or roots. It lives inside the vines of another plant. It consists of minute fiber-like structures that spread through the vine, obtaining food from the host. Rafflesia belongs to the endoparasite category since it lives inside another plant. The only part of Rafflesia that is visible outside is its large flower. These flowers smell like a rotten meat. So the pollinators are attracted towards it and the Pollination process takes place.\n2. The Mistletoe Plant:\n\nImage source\nThis is another Parasitic plant which is widely found in North America. Mistletoes are categorized as True Mistletoe sand Dwarf Mistletoes. Most of the True Mistletoes grow on deciduous trees, but some species grow on conifers trees also. Dwarf mistletoes are grown only on conifers trees. They are attached to the host tree or shrub by a structure called the Haustorium. It is a thin projection from the roots of the parasitic plants through which they extract water and nutrients from the host plant. Mistletoes belong to the category of Holoparasites. As they have green leaves, they are capable of producing chlorophyll by themselves. So they can independently prepare food by the process of Photosynthesis. But they depend on the host for water and few nutrients for their growth. It is found that the parasite and the host plants live for many years without perishing.\n \n3. Dodder Plant:\n\nImage source\nDodder, also called as Cuscuta is a common parasitic plant species which can be seen in yellow, orange and red colors. It does not contain leaves, instead, have scales on its stem. It is also known as Strangle weed as it wraps the host tree with its stem. This plant germinates from seeds as a normal plant in soil. Once it finds the host plant, it starts to wrap around the host. As it finds a good control over the host, the roots die. As its stem grows very long and resembles the thread, Dodder plants can also depend on multiple hosts and absorb the required nutrients from them. It also has Haustorium which penetrates through the host plant and helps the parasite to utilize the nutrients. Dodders are basically Obligate parasites which absorbs all the food produced by the host plants. But some species are found to perform Photosynthesis on a smaller scale. Unlike Mistletoes, this parasite won't live the host plant to survive. It covers the whole plant and absorbs all the nutrients from the host. Hence the host plants perish.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "The word 'Insects' gives a scary feeling at first. Some sort of scary insects come to our mind whenever we hear the word ' insects'.\nWe always think that the insects are troublesome for plants. But there are certain insects which are very much useful for plants.\nThey directly or indirectly contribute to the healthy growth of plants. You might be wondering which are those insects.\nLet me give a brief knowledge about some useful insects for plants.\n1. Lady Bugs:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nLadybugs are the foremost useful insects for plants. These tiny insects are commonly seen in red, yellow and orange colors. They feed on plant-eating insects such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests. These agricultural pests attack the garden and spoil the crop. In order to control such pests, Ladybugs play a very important role. They lay eggs on the colonies of these agricultural pests such that the larvae of the ladybug gets the food once it is hatched from the eggs. They also feed on mites, mealybugs and other small insects which spoil the crop. Hence they are commonly called as Natural Pest Controllers. One adult ladybug eats approximately 5000 aphids in its lifetime. But they are totally harmless for plants. Ladybugs can be attracted by planting dill, fennel, yarrow and other plants.\n2. Earthworm:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nEarthworms are called as farmer's friend. It is a very useful creature for gardeners. It helps in making the soil fertile. It feeds on the debris, manure, rotten plant parts etc and ferments it. The worms feed on the organic waste and produce nutrient-rich manure in the form of excreta. This manure is called Vermicompost. This compost will be rich in Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium compared to other composts. The excreta of earthworms are nutritious and hence the soil becomes fertile. They move throughout the soil and loosen the soil. This will allow air circulation to happen inside the soil and the roots get enough space to grow and extend. \n3. Bees:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nFlowers are the main source of nectar for bees. They feed on the flowers for their survival and also for their colonies. In turn, the bees also help them for the healthy growth. Maybe they are not helping the plants directly, but they show their gratitude indirectly. While sucking the nectar from the flowers, the pollen sticks to their body and propagate. When they sit on another flower, the pollens get exchanged and hence the pollination process takes place. This will lead to the formation of fruits. Without such pollinators, there would be no fruit and there would be no seeds hence no further growth. Both plants and the bees are interlinked in this biological system. \n4. Ground Beetles:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nGround Beetles may scare you at the first appearance. But they are the most beneficial creatures for a garden. These insects feed on the pests which affect the crops in the garden. Beetles eat Aphids, Ants, caterpillars and other troublesome pests. So it can be a substitute for chemical pesticides. A single beetle larva can eat more than 50 caterpillars in its lifetime. As they do not feed on plants, your effort in growing the plants won't be getting wasted. Some variety of Beetles eat the seeds of rapidly growing weeds. Hence the nutrition which you have provided will reach your adorable plants.\n5. Butterflies:\n\nImage source\n\nImage source\nButterflies are one of the beautiful creatures which we find everywhere around us. Even though its larvae feed on the plants, these developed creatures do not harm the plants. They visit each and every flower in your garden and suck the nectar from them. While doing so unknowingly they help in the development of the plant. While extracting the nectar from the flowers from one flower to another, they carry the pollen and help in pollination. This is the way they show their gratitude for the plants.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": " The basic component required for the growth of a plant is Nutrients. Plants grow healthy with the help of these essential components. Plants get these nutrients from soil and fertilizers. These nutrients are further classified into two categories namely Micro nutrients and Macro nutrients depending on the quantity required for the plants. These nutrients not only improves the plant's growth but also stabilizes the plant during drought and diseases. Let us know about some of the basic nutrients required for a plant to grow healthy.\n \nMacro nutrients\nThe nutrients which are required in large quantity for the efficient growth of plants are called Macro nutrients. There are about nine macro nutrients of which three are considered to be the common macro nutrients. \n1. Nitrogen (N):\n\nImage source\nNitrogen is one of the most significant macro nutrients in plants. Nitrogen is the constituent of amino acids and proteins. It is also an essential constituent of chlorophyll which helps the plant in Photosynthesis. The atmospheric air consists of about 72% of nitrogen. So nitrogen is abundantly available in the atmosphere. But due to the triple bond between the nitrogen atoms, it will not be available for the plant's use. Hence nitrogen fixation must be done in the form of ammonia (NH3) and nitrate (NO2) ions. Microorganisms play a vital role in helping the plants to absorb nitrogen. They help in the process of nitrogen fixation and converts nitrogen into ammonia and nitrate. These microorganisms will be either free-living or symbiotically connected with the plants. The ammonia and nitrate obtained will be absorbed by the roots and used by the plants for the better growth. Deficiency in nitrogen leads to the slow growth and leaf chlorosis. \n2. Potassium (K):\n\nImage source\nPotassium is also one of the vital macro nutrients required for the plants to grow healthy. But unlike the other nutrients, it does not enter any part of the plants involved in metabolism. It has a very important role to play in the growth of tender leaves and at the growing points. Potassium is one of the best nutrients when it comes to the mobility and solubility in plant tissues. This macro nutrients in plants also helps in the formation of carbohydrates and proteins in the plants. It also helps in the process of Photosynthesis under low light conditions. It also regulates the opening and closing action in stomata with potassium ion pump. Stomata is very important in water regulation, potassium regulates the water loss in the leaves and makes the plant drought tolerant. It also helps in the development of fruits with good color and shape. It also improves the sap or brix quality in the fruit. So the plants grown in potassium-rich soil can produce good quality fruits. Potassium deficiency in plants causes necrosis or interveinal chlorosis. It may also affect the growth of plants. \n3. Phosphorus (P):\n\nImage source\nPhosphorus is also one of the vital macro nutrients essential for the healthy growth of a plant. It is involved in many important plant processes. It is present inside the plants as the nucleic acid, Ribonucleic acid and Deoxyribonucleic acid as a structural component and as a constituent of fatty Phospholipids. These macro nutrients in plants are the important components for the plant function and development of membrane. All the energy transfer process inside the plant cell is dependant on Phosphorus. It is also used to change the activity of certain enzymes by phosphorylation which intern helps in cell signaling. Phosphorus is mostly seen in the actively growing parts of the plants and stored within the seeds. Phosphorus deficiency in plants can be identified by an intense green coloration or reddening in leaves due to lack of chlorophyll. If the plant is experiencing high phosphorus deficiencies the leaves may become denatured and show signs of death. Sometimes the leaves may appear purple from an accumulation of anthocyanin. As phosphorus is a mobile nutrient, older leaves will show the first signs of deficiency.\n \nSulfur (S):\n\nImage source\nSulfur is one of the macro nutrients which is responsible for Photosynthesis. This macro nutrient in plants also contributes as the structural component of amino acids and vitamins. It helps in the growth of chloroplast which is essential for photosynthesis. It is essential for nitrogen fixation through legumes and in the conversion of nitrates into amino acids and proteins. Sulfur deficiency leads to yellowing of leaves and stunted growth.\nMagnesium (Mg):\n\nImage source\nMagnesium is also an essential macro nutrient which helps in the development of a plant. It plays a very important role in plant nutrition as a constituent of the chlorophyll molecule. It is also involved in many enzyme reactions as an effective activator, in which it is closely associated with energy-supplying phosphorus compounds. It is a mobile macro nutrient in plants.\n\nCalcium (Ca):\n\nImage source\nCalcium is responsible for regulating the transport of other nutrients. It also activates certain enzymes in plants. This macro nutrient has the significance in the process of photosynthesis in plants. Calcium can also help in preventing the salinity of soils. It is essential for the root development and cell wall structure. Calcium deficiency mostly affects the roots than any other part of the plant. Stunting and Blossom end rot are also caused due to calcium deficiency.\n \n \nMicro nutrients\nMicro nutrients are the essential nutrients required in small quantity for the better growth of the plants. Even though these nutrients are required in a small quantity, they play a very important role in the growth of plants. There are several micro nutrients; let us know about some of the micro nutrients. \n\n1. Iron (Fe)\n\nImage source\nIron is one of the micro nutrients in plants which is necessary for the process of Photosynthesis to take place. It also an enzyme cofactor in plants. Iron is not a constituent of the chlorophyll but helps in the process of Photosynthesis. Deficiency in iron leads to interveinal chlorosis and necrosis. \n \n2. Molybdenum (Mo)\n\nImage source\nMolybdenum is one of the most significant micro nutrients in plants which contributes to the healthy growth of the plants. It is a cofactor of the enzymes which are responsible for building the amino acids and also involved in nitrogen metabolism. It also has a predominant role in the reduction of nitrates in nitrate reductase enzyme and in nitrogenate enzyme which is required for biological nitrogen fixation. Deficiency in Molybdenum leads to reduced productivity in plants.\n \n3. Boron (B)\n\nImage source\nBoron is also one of the vital nutrients required for the plants' growth. It is available in the form of Borate and in the highly soluble forms of organic compounds. Boron is most important for the formation and strengthening of cell walls. As Boron is required in a small amount for the plants, distributing it evenly to the soil is a bit difficult. So it is mixed with Potassium and Phosphorus components and spread to the soil. Boron deficiency leads to stunted fruits and stunted roots. \nCopper (Cu):\n\nImage source\nCopper is also one of the essential micro nutrients for plants which are responsible for the healthy growth of a plant. This micro nutrient plays a very important role in photosynthesis. It also involved in many enzyme processes which are necessary for photosynthesis. It is also involved in the formation of the cell wall and grain production. \nManganese (Mn):\n\nImage source\nManganese is essential for the process of Photosynthesis. Even though it is required in very small amount, it makes a huge difference in the growth of plants. It is also involved in nitrogen assimilation, pollen germination, root cell development etc., Magnesium deficiency leads to coloration abnormalities and discolored spots.\n \nSodium (Na):\n\nImage source\nSodium is important for the regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate which is dependant on carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is an important process required for Photosynthesis. Sodium can replace Potassium in the regulation process of stomatal opening and closing. It can also increase the leaf area and the water balance in plants.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Plants are the best companions in this world. They won't ask you anything, except a little bit of care. If you show affection towards the plants, in turn, it shows affection on you. When it comes to caring the plants - watering, growing medium and providing essential nutrients plays a very important role. Plants need nutrients rich soil to grow well. Compost is the major source of nutrients for the soil. So, you need to use good compost for the soil. Instead of buying chemical composts, you can prepare compost at home. The process of decomposing the organic waste in order to utilize the nutrients present in it for the plants is called Composting. You can compost all biodegradable wastes produced in the day to day life. There are two types of composting process namely Aerobic process and Anaerobic process. The Aerobic process takes place in the presence of air while the Anaerobic process takes place in the absence of air. Let us discuss about the effective composting methods which work on these processes.\n \nWhere do you compost?\n\nImage source\nYou need to first decide where you are going to compost the food waste. If you would like to compost at home that is well and good. If you are not willing to compost at home, you need to choose Community Composting.\n \nWhat is Community composting?\n\nImage source\nThe system of collecting the food waste or precisely biodegradable waste, from the people and training them about the composting and its importance is Community Composting. This system is very much practiced in Texas, Florida, New York and other States in the USA. There are many organizations which provide bins to compost and train them. Some apartments in India have started similar process in a smaller scale. The residents are asked to separate the dry waste and wet waste. Every morning, the housekeeping staff collects the waste from the residents. The dry waste are disposed for recycling while the wet waste is composted. This system is yet to be introduced to India in a larger scale. If introduced, the major problem caused by the generation of day to day biodegradable waste can be solved. As we do not have such system everywhere in India, the option which we have is composting at home. Here are some of the simple ways to compost at home.\n \n1. Composting in a Pit\n\nImage source\nPit composting is one of the simple ways to compost the organic food waste. There are no complications or specific procedures involved in it. You need to dig a hole or trench and bury the organic waste in the soil. Once you bury the organic waste, no need to worry about the composting for six months to one year. The microbes present in the soil convert the organic waste and turns it into compost. This is the best way to enrich the soil and does not require any special types of equipment.\n \n\n Advantages:\n\na. This method can be utilized at any place in your garden. It does not require specific place.b. No additional materials are needed as we are composting the organic waste obtained at home and burying it. c. You can compost any amount of organic matter.d. Needs minimal effort and low labor.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\na. This process is effective only if you have a big space around. b. It is a lengthy process, takes six months to one year to compost the organic matter.c. You cannot take out the compost and utilize it for potted plants.\n\n \n2. Composting in a container with aeration ( Aerobic process )\n\nImage source\nBin composting is one of the easy methods for implementing in urban homes. As the bin requires less space to accommodate, it can be easily used in the urban homes. This process can be easily done using the household materials available. You need just a container to convert the organic waste into compost. You need to pile up the organic waste inside the container and let it convert. Cover the container with a plastic sheet or a plank of wood to help retain moisture and heat. Use a rake to give the pile a quick turn to provide aeration once in a week. Within 2 - 3 months, your pile should start forming compost that is dry, dark brown and crumbly. As the container is almost kept open, there are chances of getting the foul smell and flies surrounding the container.\n \nAdvantages:\n\na. It consumes less space. So it is easy to use in urban homes.b. It does not require any special types of equipment. You can utilize the containers available in your household.c. You can harvest the compost from the bin and utilize it to the potted plants.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\na. Cannot harvest in large scale.b. As the container is kept open, you may get foul smell if the organic waste is not converted effectively.c. There are chances of mosquitoes and other flies surrounding the container and creates inconvenient atmosphere.\n\n \n3. Composting in a closed bin (Anaerobic process )\n\nComposting in a closed bin is a convenient way to compost the organic waste in urban areas and suburban areas. This process is carried out using an airtight bin to avoid air intervention. As the bin is closed tightly, heat is generated inside the bin which kills the harmful bacterias or pathogens present in the organic waste. You need to add a layer of organic waste and a layer of soil into the bin. As there is no interaction with air, there won't be sufficient microbes to convert the organic waste. We need to add the microbes to the organic waste externally. So we need to add soil to the bin. You can also get composter kits in the nearby gardening stores or online gardening websites. You get all the essential components to compost the organic waste. The whole process takes about 45 to 50 days to convert the food waste. \nAdvantages:\n\na. The bin is compact, it does not consume much space.b. No need to worry about foul smell and flies as the bin will be closed tightly.c. You can harvest the compost and utilize for potted plants.\n\n \nDisadvantages:\n\na. As the bin is kept closed most of the times, we need to add the microbes externally through soil or bokashi powder.b. Cannot compost in large quantity.\n\n4. Composting with Rotating composter method\n\n\nImage source\nRotating composter technique is very helpful in composting the food waste effectively. This can be implemented in small urban areas. A drum is suspended horizontally to the supporting stands slightly above the ground level. Both the ends of the drum is sealed and a small opening is made in the center of the drum. The food waste is added through this opening. You need to add soil to the food waste as there is no contact with the ground. As the bin is suspended, it can be easily rotated which helps the food waste in mixing with the soil. As the drum is closed, no need to worry about the flies.\nAdvantages:\n\na. The whole setup is compact and hence can be implemented in urban households.b. The rotation of the bin helps in the conversion of the food waste easily.c. This process can be done with minimal effort.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\na. Cannot compost in a large scale.b. As the drum is closed, we need to add the microbes externally through soil or Bokashi powder.\n\n \n5. Compost heap method\n\nImage source\nThis is one of the simplest and commonly used composting methods around the world. As the name itself suggests, you need to make a heap of biodegradable materials and soil. There is no need of any additional materials. The microbes present naturally in the soil converts the organic wastes and converts it into compost. This technique is generally practiced in a large space where the bigger heap can be made and composted. \n \nAdvantages:\n\na. You can compost large quantity of organic waste. \nb. This method can be utilized at any place in your garden. It does not require specific place.c. No additional materials are needed as we are composting the organic waste obtained at home and burying it. d. Needs minimal effort and low labor.\ne. You can harvest the compost and utilize it for potted plants.\n\n \nDisadvantages:\n\na. This process is effective only if you have a big space around.b. It is a lengthy process, takes six months to one year to compost the organic matter.\nc. As the process takes place in open field, there are chances of mosquitoes and other flies surrounding the heap and creates inconvenient atmosphere.\n \n\n6. Vermiculture method or Vermicompost\n\nImage source\nThe process of cultivating earthworms in order to convert organic waste into fertilizer is called Vermiculture. You can implement this method in a container. Fill the container with layers of food waste and soil. Add some earthworms to the container. The worms feed on the organic waste and produce nutrient-rich manure in the form of excreta. This manure is called Vermicompost. This compost will be rich in Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium compared to other composts. \n \nAdvantages:\n\na. It consumes less space. So it is easy to use in urban homes.b. It does not require any special types of equipment. You can utilize the containers available in your household.c. You can harvest the compost from the bin and utilize it to the potted plants.\nd. It is 100% organic process as we are using earthworms for the conversion.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\na. Cannot compost in a large scale.b. As the drum is closed, we need to add the microbes externally through soil or Bokashi powder.\nc. Earthworms cannot digest the meat. So you cannot compost meat in this process.\n \n\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter\n\n\n\n",

        "articleBody": "Maintaining the plants during the hot summer is a big headache for garden enthusiasts. The water poured for the plants get evaporated due to the hot weather. The plants absorb nutrients present in the soil through the water. So the plants start to weaken as they won't get sufficient water. In order to avoid such scenarios, we need to maintain the moisture content of the soil. Here are some of the easiest ways to maintain the soil during summer.\n1. Watering the plants adequately\n\nImage source\nWatering the plants adequately is one of the easiest methods to maintain the soil temperature during hot summer. Mere watering won't help. Overwatering won't help your plants in any way. You need to water for the plant growth in a proper way. Here are some tips to water your plants.\nTip: 1 - Water at a right time\n\nImage source\nWater the plants either in the early morning or in the late evening. If you water the plants in the afternoon during hot summer, the water evaporates and the soil won't get the required amount of water. This will weaken the plant and the plant will perish. \nTip: 2 - Use Drip Irrigation\n\nUse Drip irrigation technique to water the plants. This technique not only reduces human effort but also saves water. As the water flows slowly and continuously, the soil gets the interaction with water and stays wet for a longer time. Drip irrigation helps the plants to absorb the water and helps in plant growth. \n \nTip: 3 - Use Watering can with Nozzle\n\nImage source\nUse the watering can with a perforated nozzle to control overwatering. The water will be equally distributed to every plant. If you are watering the plants using the pipe, there are chances of water pressure uprooting the plants.\n\nTip: 4 - Reuse the plastic bottles \n\nImage source\nInstead of throwing the used plastic bottles, you can use it for watering the plants. Take the bottles and make a bunch of holes in it. Bury the bottles beside the plants such that the neck of the bottle is above the soil. Fill the bottles with water once in a day. The water inside the bottle reaches the soil slowly and keeps the soil moist. As you have buried the bottle in the soil, the water won't get evaporated and will easily serve the need and improve the plant growth.\n \n2. Using Shade Nets\n\nImage source\nPlants require sunlight to grow well. But some plants cannot withstand the excess of sunlight. They need a little shade to grow. Excess of sunlight may burn them and the plants may perish. So, protecting the plants from high sunlight is very much essential. You can use the shade nets to protect your plants from high sunlight. The shade nets are capable of avoiding direct sunlight. So they protect the plants during hot summer. They also help in maintaining the moisture level around the plants. You can easily purchase these shade nets from the nearest gardening stores or through online gardening websites.\n \n3. Mulching\n\nImage source\nMulching is one of the useful technique to maintain the soil temperature. The technique of covering the top layer of soil in order to protect from evaporation is called Mulching. Generally, leaves, pebbles, wood barks, grass etc., will be used as Temporary mulch. They do not allow the water to evaporate during hot summers. They act as a protective layer. They also reduce the water consumption by 70% and keeps the soil moist. You can also use compost as a mulch. Doing so you are not only protecting the soil from high sunlight but also providing the plants with essential nutrients.\n\nImage sourcePlastic sheets and rubber sheets are used as Permanent mulches in extremely hot places. But it cannot be used in all the places. In winter, the plants need a minimum amount of sunlight to grow. If you install these permanent mulch, they won't allow the sunlight and hence the plant growth will be suppressed and plant cannot grow healthy. So I suggest using temporary mulch.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "As we all know plants are grown in the soil. They absorb the nutrients present in the soil to grow healthy. Generally Compost and fertilizers are added to the soil to make it fertile and in turn to make the plants healthy. So compost and fertilizers are the main sources of nutrients for the plants. What if I say certain plants eat other living creatures to grow instead of fertilizers??Yes, you got it right. There are a certain variety of plants which feed on other living creatures especially on insects for food. These plants are called Carnivorous plants or Insectivorous plants. Let us know about some of the  insectivorous plants.\n1. Pitcher plant or Nepenthes plant\n\nImage sourceNepenthes plant or commonly called as Pitcher plant is a variety of carnivorous plant. Its pitcher-shaped leaves have given this name as Pitcher Plant. It has a unique type of leaves called Pitfall Traps. These traps produce a sweet pigment which attracts the insects and trap them inside a big cavity. The cavity contains the digestive liquid which digests the insects and serves as nutrients for the plant.\n\nImage source\n\nSee the PItcher plant Trapping its Prey\n\nImage source\nGenerally, Flies and insects are the common prey for this insectivorous plant. The surface of the pitfall trap will be slippery. Once the insect gets attracted by the nectar, they come towards the trap and fall inside the cavity. Some species also have hair like structures or waxed surfaces on the inner side of the cavity such that the hairs and the wax surface do not leave the insects to climb up. Once the insect fall inside the cavity, the liquid present in the cavity digests the insect and converts it into the essential form and helps for the plant's growth. These plants grow in the soil which lacks in minerals or in acidic soil. So they obtain the necessary nutrients by digesting the insects. This variety of plant is grown in the high rainfall areas of South America.\n \n2. Venus Flytrap\n\nImage sourceVenus Flytrap plant is another variety of plant which belongs to insectivorous plants category. Its claw like structure with the long finger-like protrusions on the terminals of the leaves works as the trap. The inner side of the trap has small hairs which are sensitive to the movement of the insects. The mechanism has the ability to distinguish between the genuine prey and fake stimulations. The hair-like patterns on the inner part must get stimulated at least twice for the trap to shut. Once the insects stimulate the hairs, the trap shuts and the insects will be stuck inside. If the prey starts moving inside the trap or tries to escape, it tightens the trap and the digestion process will be vigorous. The trap typically opens within 12 hours waiting for next prey to get trapped.\n\nImage source\n \nSee the Venus Flytrap In action\n\nImage source\nSome of the venus flytrap plants are fully green in color and some have red shades on the inner part of the trap. Generally, beetles, crawling insects, spiders and other terrestrial insects are the major prey for this insectivorous plant. Apart from these insects, sometimes even flies are trapped by this plant. They utilize the nutrients from the insects to grow as the soil in which they grow does not have any nutrients in it. This variety of plant can be seen in East coasts of North Carolina and South Carolina, United States. \n \n3. Drosera\n\nImage sourceDrosera, or commonly called as Sundew is another insectivorous plant. It is the largest genera of carnivorous species. There are nearly 124 varieties belonging to this species. Sundew plants capture the insects and digest them using the glands present on the surface of the leaves. Tentacles will be present on the glands with sticky fluid at the tip of the tentacles. These tentacles trap the insects which sit on the leaves and digest them gradually by rolling them in the leaves.\n\nImage source\n \nDrosera Having its meal\n\nImage source \nMost of the terrestrial and flying insects are preys of this insectivorous plant. The digestive liquid secreted at the tip of the tentacles attracts the insects towards the sundew plant and hence the insects are trapped by the same fluid. The insects think it is nectar and comes to suck the nectar. But they fall into the trap of the Drosera plant. Once the insect gets trapped in the sticky tentacles, the leaf slowly folds, rolls the insect and digest it. As the soil in which they grow does not have any nutrients, they utilize the nutrients from the insects for their growth. This kind of plants can be seen in Wallums of coastal Australia, Fynbos of South Africa and some European countries like Germany, Austria, Switzerland etc.,\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

It is better to germinate the seeds using a seedling tray so that the seeds can germinate easily without any external disturbances.Once the saplings grow to a certain height you need to transplant them either to pots or directly to the soil. Make sure to use a nutrient-rich potting mix to grow the plants else the plant won't get sufficient nutrients and hence they perish. I suggest using natural fertilizers as they won't harm the plant in future. \nWatering tips\nAs Marigold is a cool weather crop, it does not require much water. You can water them once in 2 days during summer and 3 days once during winter and rainy season. Do not overwater, else the plant gets affected by the fungal disease and the plants will perish.\nHarvesting\nThe Marigold flowers are ready for harvest after 45 to 60 days from germination.

Once the saplings reach 2 to 3 inches height, you can transplant them to the bigger pots or directly to the land. A good potting mix containing essential nutrients is required for the saplings to grow well. I suggest using organic fertilizers in order to keep the plant healthy. As cosmos is a summer plant, it cannot sustain less sunlight. So it is better to grow the plant outdoors.\nWatering tips\nCosmos plant consumes more water when compared to other plants. So, it's better to water twice a day or at least once in a day during summer. During winter water the plants once in 2 days and do not water during rainy season unless the plant is not getting the rainwater. \nHarvesting\nCosmos flowers can be harvested after 60 to 70 days from germination.

The flower has the tendency to turn towards the sun. So it has been named as Sunflower. Summer is the best season to grow Sunflower plant. It requires minimum 20 degrees C to grow well. It can be grown both in pots as well as directly on the ground. We suggest germinating the seeds using a seedling tray and transplant it to the soil once the plant reaches about 2 to 3 inches in height. As the seed coating is thick, the seeds need about 10 to 20 days to germinate. If the weather is cool, you can cover the Sunflower plant using a plastic. Make a couple of holes so that the plants get sufficient air.While transplanting the saplings to the pots or to the soil, make sure to provide a good potting mix which contains the essential nutrients. I suggest using organic fertilizers in order to keep both the plant and the soil healthy. Sunflower plant requires minimum 6 to 8 hours of sunlight. So make sure to place the plant in ample sunlight.

So it is better to place the plants outdoors where the plants get sufficient sunlight.Once the seeds germinate and the saplings grow about 2 to 3 inches height, you can transplant them to a bigger pot or directly to the soil. As soil plays a vital role in the growth of a plant, I suggest using a good potting mix containing the essential nutrients. It is better to use organic fertilizers rather than chemical ones. The chemical ones will no doubt makes the plant give good yield but gradually spoils the fertility of the soil. You can prepare organic fertilizer at home by composting the biodegradable food waste generated at home.\nWatering tips\nYou need to water the plants regularly during summer, once in 2 days during winter and once in 2 days during rainy season if the rainwater is not reaching the plants.\nHarvesting\nYou can harvest the balsam flowers after 60 to 70 days from germination.

So it is said not to sleep under the tamarind tree.\n \nScientific view\n\nWe do not get sufficient oxygen near the tamarind tree during night times. Its leaves will fold and avoids the air circulation. As it contains Tartaric acid, the soil around it becomes barren. So no other plant grows around it. This makes the atmosphere around it unhealthy with deficiency of oxygen. As we all know a person cannot breathe without oxygen, the person who sleeps under the tamarind tree falls sick due to Oxygen deficiency but not due to the influence of any spirit.\n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Are you fed up of trying to germinate seeds and facing failures?? Kick Out your frustrations. I'm here to help you out with some easy germination hacks today. From the day I thought of having a home garden, many questions were repeatedly running through my mind. Being a beginner, it took days together rather months together for me to understand something about gardening. Generally, people prefer growing some vegetable plants or flower plants from seeds at home. But due to lack of experience, they won't be knowing the right way to grow those plants. They will try to grow in some random way but it won't work. At this point, they will lose their interest in gardening. By choosing the good quality soil for plants and treating it with organic fertilizer, your dream of having a house garden can be achieved.\nNow the question is how to make the seeds germinate efficiently.\n\nGERMINATION\n\n \n\nImage source\nGermination is a stage where a seed turns into a plant. Most of the seeds germinate in the soil. But some of the seeds can be germinated in moisture. The most common example for germination is sprouting. If you soak green peas in water for few hours, it will be sprouted. This has to be sown in the soil for the further growth. There are some easy ways to germinate the seeds. \n\nHack - 1 Soaking the seeds in water\n\nImage sourceBy soaking the seeds in water for few hours, you can enhance the germination of the seeds. Use warm water while soaking so that the seeds sprout well. Soaking for 8 to 12 hours will do the trick for you. Oversoaking will decompose the seeds and spoil your whole effort. So take care of the time while soaking. Once the seeds sprout, you can place them in soil and start growing.\n\nHack - 2 Wrapping the seeds in wet clothes\n\n\nImage source\n\nImage source                                                 By wrapping the seeds in a wet cloth for 24 hours, you can enhance the germination of the seeds. Do not keep it for more than 24 hours, else the seeds will get spoiled. Once the seeds sprout, you can place them in soil and start growing.\n\nHack - 3 Seedling tray method\n\nImage source\nSeedling tray method is a best practice to germinate seeds. Due to rain sometimes there are chances of losing the seeds. In the seedling tray method, seeds can be germinated safely and easily. You can maintain the seeds in the tray till it germinates. But when the plant reaches 2 to 3 inches in length it requires some more space to grow. So you need transplant into the pot or directly to the land.\n\nHack - 4  Direct Sow method\n\n\nImage source\nThis is the most commonly used method. We can grow plants by sowing the seeds directly in the pots or on the ground.\n1. Poke the soil approximately to 2 inch which forms a small hole.\n2. Place the seed inside it and close it with soil and sprinkle a little bit of water. 3. Keep sprinkling the water once in 2 days. Within few weeks you can see the germination. 4. Maintain constant moisture in the soil / growing medium.5. You have to avoid direct sunlight till the seeds sprout.\n \nHack - 5 Sowing small seeds\n \n\nImage source\nIf the seeds are very small, sowing them is a bit difficult job. We cannot distribute them equally in the soil. So, take a cup of soil and mix the seeds with the soil. Then sprinkle the soil - seeds mixture so that the seeds will germinate easily.\nHack - 6 Sowing thickly coated seeds\n \n\nImage source\nIf the seed coat is thick as in the bean seeds, rub off the outer layer gently using a pair of sandpaper and then sow. The seeds will germinate easily.\n\nHack - 7 Using squeezed lemon peels \n\n\nImage source\nYou can use the lemon peels after squeezing to germinate the seeds. Its self-composting property adds up the nutrients to the soil. Just make a hole in the peel for drainage, fill the peel with soil and sow the seeds. You can transplant the seedlings once it reaches about 3 to 4 inches in height.\nHack - 8 Using Epsom salt\n\nImage source\nYou can add Epsom salt to the soil for good germination. Add about 2 tablespoons of Epsom salt to the hole before sowing the seed. It contains hydrated magnesium sulfate which strengthens the cell walls and leads to a stronger seedling. It also helps in absorbing vital nutrients from the soil.\nHack - 9 Starch gel method\n\nImage source\nYou can also use starch gel method to sow small seeds. Take some cornstarch and add it to a cooking pan. Add sufficient water to make a starch solution. Place the cooking pan on the stove and boil it for about 2 minutes. Let the solution to cool and pour the solution into a zipper plastic bag. Put the seeds into the solution and distribute it throughout the solution using a spoon or a small stick. Make a small opening in the bottom corner of the bag. Pour the mixture into the soil in rows through the opening and cover it with a thin layer of soil and water them. The gel dissolves in few days and the seeds start germinating.\n \n\nWeather conditions\n\n\nImage sourceWeather condition plays a very important role in gardening. Generally, plants grow faster in warm temperature. On the other hand, it requires a certain amount of moisture as well. Extreme hot temperature leads to moisture loss and extreme cold temperature affects the growth of plants due to lack of warmth. Even though we cannot control the weather, we can at least create the favorable condition which can minimize the negative effects of weather on the plants up to a certain extent by the process of mulching.\n\nImage sourceMulching is the process of covering the soil with certain materials to avoid weather fluctuations. Mulching is done to protect the plants from high temperature. They help the soil in retaining the moisture in the soil, regulating the soil temperature and suppressing the growth of weeds around the plants. Mulch is basically a layer of the soil and the atmosphere.\n\nImage source\nIt can be prepared with dry leaves, pebbles, shredded newspapers and tree bark chips as temporary mulch or using the plastic sheets or recycled tire rubber around the plants as permanent mulch. Mulching can help the plants in maintaining the moisture of the soil and avoiding weed growth. Mulching can also increase the soil productivity.The optimal temperature varies with the type of plants we grow. Plants cannot withstand wide temperature fluctuation. So here are some easy hacks to protect your plants from extreme conditions. \n \nHack - 1 Covering the plants\n\nImage source\nYou can protect the plants from direct sunlight by covering them with plastic or by shade cloth. They not only protect the plants from high temperature but also protect them from freezing cold. You can buy them from nearby gardening stores or you can make use of old clothes or plastic sheets to create shade.\nHack - 2 Drip irrigation\n\nDrip irrigation also helps to keep the soil moist and protects the plants during hot weather. It not only helps in conserving the water but also reduces human effort.\nHack - 3 The right time to water\n\nImage source\nWater the plants early in the morning or early in the evening during the hot season. If you water during the midday or in the afternoon, the water evaporates and the plants won't get the required amount of water to grow.\nHack - 4 Protecting the saplings from direct sunlight\n\nImage source\nIf you are transplanting the saplings from the seedling tray or small pots to the soil, make sure to place them behind the bigger plants so that they will be protected from direct sunlight.\nHack - 5 Keeping the soil moist\n \n\nImage source\nTake a used water bottle and make a bunch of holes in it. Bury it besides the plant and fill it with water. The water flows slowly into the soil and provides sufficient moisture for the roots also during summer. It works similar to drip irrigation.\n \nHack - 6 Hardening off \n\nImage source\nDuring cold nights you need to keep the potted plants indoors where the temperature is comparatively high such that the plants won't suffer from cold.  You can make your saplings comfortable in any season by the process called \"Harden Off\". This can also be called as the seasoning of the saplings. Introduce your plants to sunlight for a shorter time in the beginning and increase the duration gradually and decrease the frequency of watering. But make sure the plants are not wilted. Similarly, exposing them to cold weather by gradually increasing the duration. Once the saplings are hardened, they will be adjusted for any temperature fluctuation. So you can transplant the saplings. Make sure to nurture the transplanted ones with water and fertilizers in order to avoid transplant shock.\n \nCARING FOR PLANTS\na. Selecting a good Growing medium\nYou need to select good soil to place the saplings. Nutrient-rich soil helps the plant give a good yield. Once the saplings are transplanted to the soil, you need to provide sufficient water and sunlight. You can also use coco peat instead of normal soil.\nCoco peat is an organic growing medium made of coconut fiber. It can be used as a substitute for soil. It has a capacity to absorb water and hold it for a long time. Its antifungal property helps the plants to grow healthy. It is the most convenient growing medium as it is lightweight. But when compared to normal soil, it does not have any nutrients in it. You need to add the nutrients externally. You can use either vermicompost or any organic fertilizers.\n \nFor a better germination, it is suggested to use a lighter growing medium. You can use Cocopeat as the growing medium as it is lighter compared to the normal soil. The seeds can be compared to a fetus. It will not be having the capacity to absorb any nutrients from the soil. It just needs a loose growing medium so that the germination happens easily. Once the saplings reach a considerable stage, it needs nutrients to grow. So we need to transplant them to a fertile soil or growing medium. We can feed them with nutrients like compost, perlite etc., \n \nb. Providing essential nutrients to the soil\n\nImage sourceFertilizers play a very important role in the growth of plants. They contain proteins and minerals required for a plant to grow healthy. Fertilizers are used to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying its water retention and aeration. You get organic as well as artificial fertilizers in the market. Artificial fertilizers contain chemicals in it which may help the plant to grow well. But it affects the soil in long run. Due to chemicals, the soil loses its natural essence and turns out to be infertile. So make sure to use organic compost. It is easy to prepare in your household. You can prepare organic compost using the kitchen waste and animal waste by composting method. To know how to prepare organic compost, please refer to our product Trustbin.\n\nc. Watering\n\nWater is an essential component for plants to grow healthy. Some plants require more water and some require less. So, you need to take care of watering according to the requirement. Keep this in mind, plants won't grow faster by overwatering. You need to maintain the moisture content in the soil / growing medium.\nd. Providing sufficient sunlight\n\nImage sourceAs you all know, plants convert the nutrients present in the soil to the essential form through Photosynthesis. Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis to take place. Some plants require more sunlight and some require less sunlight. So, depending on the requirement you need to decide where to place the planted pots. If you have planted directly in the ground, you can avoid direct sunlight by covering the plants with plastic with a small hole for air to circulate.You can place the pots on your balcony or terrace as per the requirement of sunlight. For any seed to germinate healthily, a sufficient amount of warmth is required. But you need to avoid direct sunlight during the time of germination. Once it germinates and the saplings reach 2 to 3 inches in height, you need to provide sufficient sunlight.\ne. Pest control\n\nImage sourceGenerally, plants are prone to pests and diseases. Pesticides are used to keep the plants healthy. Artificial pesticides contain chemicals in it which may help the plant to get rid of diseases and pests. But it affects the yield in long run. So it is better to use natural pesticides.\n1. \n\n                                            Image source\nNeem oil is a natural pesticide. It avoids the disease-causing pests on one hand and also enriches the soil on the other hand. Add about 30 to 40 ml of neem oil to 1-liter water and sprinkle it on the plants. You can also use a salt spray, Eucalyptus oil, Garlic spray etc.,\n2.\n\nImage source\nYou can cover the plants with used big plastic bottles or jugs to protect them from bugs. It also protects your plants from cold weather and keeps them warm.\n \n3. \n\nUse Sticky Cellophane Tape to get rid of Garden Pests. Instead of using water to remove the small insect pests which sticks underneath the leaves and on the stem, wrap the sticky tape in such way that the sticky side on top and remove the pests easily. \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

Mix 20 to 50 ml of neem oil into a liter of water and spray on the plants. If the infection is severe repeat the spray once or twice at a week interval.\n\nDamping off\n\nImage source\nIt is a horticultural soil-borne fungal disease which kills or weakens the seeds or sapling before germination or after the germination. It mostly occurs in cool conditions. Slow growth and sudden collapse of plants are common symptoms of this plant disease. The seed might have been decaying in the soil due to the hardness of the seeds.Taking proper decision while choosing seeds will play a vital role. Buying it from a nursery, from a horticulture institute or a reputed buyer would preferably go well to avoid seed and soil-borne diseases. \nPlants Affected:\nPapaya,capsicum,chili,tomato,onion\nCauses of the disease:\nThis disease is caused by different kind of pathogens weakening the seeds or the plants and killing them. These pathogens feed on the plants and in turn, make the plants perish.\n\nPlant Disease symptoms:\nThere are many symptoms when it comes to Damping off. As this disease is caused by different kind of pathogens, the symptoms vary from each species.Here are some common symptoms.1. A sudden collapse of the saplings in the growing stage and slow growth of the plants.\n\nImage source\n2. Roughly round patches on the seedlings can be seen.\n\nImage source\n3. Lesions on the stem are also observed.\n\nImage source\nPrecautionary measures:\nSowing the seeds in sterilized and a good quality potting mix is the foremost precaution you need to take.

        "articleBody": "Aphids are a variety of tiny insects which destroy the plants. They suck the sap of the plants and weakens the plants and in turn destroy the plant. They also act as vectors for plant viruses which weakens the plants. They secrete sticky honeydew deposits and supports the growth of sooty moulds on the leaves. They mostly feed on the back of the leaves. Most common variety of Aphids are green flies, black flies and white woolly aphids. Apart from them, brown flies and pink flies are also seen sometimes. They have a bean-shaped body with two antennas on their head. They are mostly found in large numbers but found singly or in small numbers sometimes.\nPlants Affected:\nApple, Pear, Grape, Bean, Capsicum, Chilli, Eggplant, Pea, Cucumber, Tomato, Cabbage, Lettuce, Potato, Gram, Pigeon Pea, Chickpea, Cotton, Wheat, Onion, Millet, Sorghum, Maize, Banana, Peanut, Papaya etc.,\n\nCause of the disease:\n\nImage source\nThe only cause for this plant disease is aphids depending on the plants for food. They feed on the plants sap in order to maintain metabolism. As they suck the sap which serves as the main source of food for plants, the plants become weaker and perish.\n\nDisease symptoms:\n \n1. Formation of colonies\n\nImage sourceWe can see colonies of these aphids on the leaves and stems of the plants.\n \n2. Wilting of leaves\n\nImage source\nThe leaves start wilting and distorting as they don't get sufficient nutrients.\n3. Honeydew formation\n\nImage source\nHoneydews and sooty black fungus are formed on the leaves and the stems of the plants.These are the general symptoms to know whether your plants are affected by aphids or not. The other symptoms depend on the type of plant viruses that affect the plants. So they do not have specific symptoms.\n\n Preventive measures:\n\nAs they are physically occurring through the insects, there is no way to prevent except keeping the surroundings of the plant neat and tidy.\nWay to cure the disease:\n1. Biological method:\n\nImage sourceLadybugs are considered to be gardener's friend. They won't harm the crop. They eat aphids to survive. So, you can grow plants like Dill, Caraway, Carrot, Carrot, Yarrow etc., which attracts Ladybugs. 2. Physical Removal:\nFor minor aphids, It is better to remove the insects from your plants by Wearing a pair of gardening gloves and brush or pinch the pests from stems and leaves. If the infection is contained in one or two stalks or branches, prune off the affected portion(s) and drop them into a bucket of soapy water to kill the aphids.3. Water Pressure:\n\nImage sourceSpraying water by using gardening hose would remove and get rid of aphids and avoids further growth of baby aphids.\n\n4. Soap and Water:\n\nImage sourceBy using household mild dish soap mixing it with warm luke water and spraying on the affected leaves effectively.It is important to spray even at the backsides of the leaves where small populations of baby aphids are grown.\n5. Neem Oil:\nSame way as dish soap, pure Neem oil should be diluted in water and sprayed into plants infested with aphids. We can prevent the Aphids feeding on the plants by using neem oil spray. As neem oil is an organic pesticide, it prevents the aphids to grow on the plant. Mix about 50ml of neem oil with 1 liter of water and spray the mixture to the plants.\n\n6. Essential Oil:\n\nImage sourceMixing up equal quantities of thyme, peppermint, clove, rosemary oils (each 4-5)spoons and spraying upon on the plants would also act as a helpful repellent.\n\n \nThat's all for today....\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

As you have the plants around the house, you get sufficient amount of fresh air to breath. It not only enhance your health but also beautify your home.But the plant disease affecting the plants make the gardening hard. Unless you know the way to cure the plants, it becomes difficult to maintain such disease affected plants. So, we have listed some common plant disease and given a brief note about the diseases, their causes and cure.\n \nROOT ROT\nImage sourceRoot rot is one of the common fungal diseases of potted plants. As the name only says the roots of the plants rot. This may be due to poor drainage. There is less chance for plants grown directly on the ground to get prone to this disease. As these plants have sufficient space around them, the water flows throughout the soil and decreases the chance of roots rotting. But in the case of potted plants, the chances of this disease is comparatively high. In most of the cases, potted plants are affected by this fungal disease. Prolonged exposure of the roots in water makes the root decay due to lack of oxygen. So the roots start to die and the plant perish.\nCause of the disease:\nIf the water does not get sufficient space to go out or if the pots do not have a drainage hole for the water to go out, the water starts collecting around the plants and the roots start rotting. It can also happen if you over water the plants. Overwater creates lack of oxygen and the roots rot. Once the root starts rotting, it loses the ability to absorb the nutrients from the soil and hence the plants will perish.\nPlant disease symptoms:\n \n1. Stunting: \n\nImage source\nOnce the roots start to rot, it loses the ability to absorb the vital nutrients from the soil. So the leaves start contracting due to lack of nutrients. This is called Stunting.\n\n2. Wilting of leaves: \nImage source\nAs the roots lose the ability to absorb the nutrients, they start to die. Due to lack of nutrients, the leaves lose strength and Wilt. \n\n3. Discolored leaves:\n\n\nImage source\nDiscolored leaves are the common symptoms of this diseases. The leaves turn yellow and get dried due to excess of moisture to the roots. \n \nPreventive measures:\nAs the excess of moisture is the main cause of this disease,watering the plants only when the soil is dry is the best way to prevent it. Use loose soil with good air circulation facility so that the water does not store at the roots. You get many chemical fungicides in the store. But we do not suggest using the chemicals as they may spoil the health of the soil in the long run.\n\nWay to Cure the disease:\n\nImage sourceTake out the plant from the affected soil and dispose of the soil. Wash the roots in the running water so that the affect root part gets washed away. Remove the affected roots by trimming them using shears or scissors. Dip the roots in the fungicide solution to remove the traces of rot fungus. It is preferred to use organic fungicides instead of chemical ones.\n \nMaking organic fungicide at home:\n \nImage source\nYou can make organic fungicide at home by adding 2 tablespoons of baking soda to 1 liter of water. Re-pot the plants in a healthy potting mix and loose soil which helps in good air circulation. Make sure the pot has good drainage facility for the excess water to go out.\n \nThat's all for today. I'll come back soon with some more details.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

They should not consume the space but should fit in the place and beautify the place. Now you will have a question in mind. What to Grow and how to grow?\nLack of knowledge about gardening may also be the reason. Generally, people prefer growing some vegetable plants or flower plants. How nice would it be if we could grow tomatoes or onions? We can eat the vegetables grown in our own garden.But they won't be knowing the right way to grow those plants. They will try to grow in some random way but it won't work. At this point, they will lose their interest in gardening. By choosing the good quality soil for plants and treating it with organic fertilizer your dream of having a house garden can be achieved.Lack of gardening resourcesIn today's world, you will find anything and everything in the market. In bigger cities, people can get the house gardening materials which they need from the markets or retail shops. But when it comes to smaller cities, there is less possibility of finding the materials which they need. Now the question arises, where can we get the required house gardening materials?\nThe Internet has made this world smaller and easily accessible to anything and everything. If you are familiar with using the internet and know your complete address, then shopping will be in your fingertip. You can order the required gardening materials online.

It is the substitute for soil. It has a potential of holding a lot of water inside. You can buy this coco peat online.There are some plants which can be grown in all seasons. For instance, Rose and Hibiscus can be grown in all the seasons. But some plants are seasonal. They grow only in a particular season. For instance, Flowering of Jasmine starts during March–April and continues up to June–July. April –May is the peak season.\n                              \nImage source\n2. About the germination of plants\nImage sourceGermination is a stage where a seed turns into a plant. Most of the seeds germinate in the soil. But some of the seeds can be germinated in moisture. The most common example for germination is sprouting. If you soak green peas in water for few hours, it will be sprouted. This has to be sown in the soil for the further growth. Then arises a question how to sow the seed?3. Seed Germination tips\nImage source1. Poke the soil approximately to 2inch which forms a small hole.2. Place the seed inside it and close it with soil and sprinkle a little bit of water. 3. Keep sprinkling the water once in 2 days. within few weeks you can see the germination. 4. Maintain constant moisture in the soil / growing medium.5. You have to avoid direct sunlight till the seeds sprout.Do not over water. If the leaves turn yellow, it is the indication of over watering. Even if the top layer of soil looks dry, there will be moisture inside. Use watering can to water the plants.

It is fragile when compared to other types of pots.\nThe next best type of pot is garden planters. This may not have the advantages as Terracotta pots. When compared to terracotta pots, the roots cannot grow freely in garden planters. But the pot can be recycled. This won't harm the environment as it doesn't contain any chemicals in it. You can purchase metal planters of different size and different designs such as hanging planters, railing planters, tabletop pots etc.,\n\nYou can also have cement pots. But it has its own disadvantage. These pots are heavy and cannot be transported from one place to another easily. The next type of pot is plastic pot. This may not be a better suggestion but can be an option. The roots cannot grow as freely as in terracotta pots here. Moreover, plastic pots are not eco-friendly. You can also use grow bags for growing plants.Although every type pots have their own limitations, they all help in maintaining the greenery around you and also beautify your place.5. Maintaining the plants\nWhen compared to regular crops, these home garden doesn't require much maintenance. You can use the food waste and the plant waste as fertilizer by the process of composting. You can purchase composter bins which help you in preparing the organic compost in your household. Do not use any chemical fertilizer. If you see any pests eating leaves or affecting plants, then you can use neem oil as an organic pesticide. You have to dilute the Neem oil in the ratio of 1:20 in water and spray it on the plants. Do not use any chemical pesticide on it.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "Greens can be grown anywhere if there is an availability of sunlight. Like vegetables or fruits, greens are not heavy feeders. These greens do not require regular fertilizing to reward you with fresh tender leaves. They can be grown anywhere like balcony, terrace, or in your kitchen gardens. Spinach is among those wonderful greens high in fiber, iron, calcium, folic acid, and proteins.\n All about growing Spinach in your garden\n\nMake your garden beautiful by growing palak/spinach plants. Spinach plant is a rich source of vitamin B, C, E and healthiest source of nutrients and minerals. Usage of spinach to prepare your various dishes like curries, sandwiches, salads, juice etc.\nThinking of planting spinach seeds???\nJust follow these simple 4 steps to grow spinach.\n\nImage Source\nStep 1: Choose the best season to plant\nSpinach seeds are best to grow in normal temperature of about 17-18 degree Celsius. It resists to high temperature also. If the temperature is high then keep the planters indoor or make them get shade. They will not germinate quickly in cold weather also. It must require a minimum of 5 to 6 hours of sunlight daily.\n\nImage Source\nTips to plant spinach seeds\n\nYou can plant either in pots or in your garden\nYou can also use the seedling tray to plant and can transplant.\nChoose the best area with the good amount of sunlight.\nMake sure to plant in a good organic soil which drains well.\n\n\nImage Source\n\nStep 2: Process of planting spinach seeds\nSow seeds ½ inches (1cm) deep into the soil and 2 inches (5cm) apart. If you are planting in rows, make sure the rows are spaced at least 8 inches apart. Doing so allows the seeds to mature without having to compete for space. Also be sure that the seeds are not exposed to the air and are completely covered by soil.\nIf you are sowing seeds in a seedling tray, then transplant the seedlings to the prepared soil. Spinach seeds have fine, fibrous roots so try to avoid disturbing them too much while transplanting.\nWhen you are transplanting seedlings, place the spinach plants about 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) apart. This allows the seedlings to grow and expand their roots without competing with each other for space.\nMake sure to buy fresh seeds for planting each year, as they do not stay viable for long.\n\nImage Source\nWatering\nSpinach is a high water consumer plant, it requires more water. Spray water frequently but do not over water it. You can maintain watering as below.\n\nSummer: Water once in a day.\nWinter: Water once in two to three days.\nRainy: If rainwater is flowing to the plant, no need to water it. In case not, water once in three days.\n\n\nFertilizer\nSoil makes a basic and important role in growing plants. It helps plants by providing nutrients as organic food. If your soil is not good enough with organic food, plants might be attacked by pests and diseases or it may dry off.  So it is necessary to add fertilizers to make your plants good and healthy. You can use potting mix or compost as fertilizers.\nStep 3: Germination of palak seeds\nPalak seeds will germinate in about 1 to 2 weeks. At the time of germination, you should take care of it by watering them, making them get enough sunlight. Add fertilizers in case of any diseases.\n\nImage Source\nCare to be taken for germinated palak/spinach plants\n\n\nThinning your plants: If your seedling is thick, then you need to thin them lightly to prevent the plants from competing for space. This makes them get a good amount of moisture, nutrients, light etc for proper growth without competing for other.\n\nKeep your planting area moist: You need to keep the soil moist by spraying water but not overly drenched. Depending on the climate u should water your palak crop as mentioned above.\n\nCover the plants with a shade in case of high temperature (above 26°C): As mentioned above, palak crop does not do well in high temperature. In case of summer season or high temperature, you need to keep the plants indoors or make them get a shade.\n\n\n\n\nFertilize your plants only when necessary: If your plants are growing slowly, you need to add more fertilizer as mentioned above.\n\nBolting: The phenomenon of producing seeds by a premature plant (producing flowers early) and making it unsuitable for consumption is known as bolting. It occurs when a plant undergoes stress in its growing period. In spinach, this situation generally takes place due to stress factors like inadequate watering, too much sunlight by which the spinach plant starts producing flowers, and a change in the taste and flavor of leaves occurs. Solution: Water them thoroughly and let the soil become slightly dry between watering. Protect these sensitive greens from harsh sunlight (noon light) using shade nets.\n\nPests and diseases: There are some possibilities to get pests and diseases while growing. If you are facing this problem, spray Neem oil on your plants. Add 20 to 50 ml of Neem oil to a liter of water and spray on the spinach plants. If the infection is severe repeat the spray once or twice at a week interval.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Source\n\nStep 4: Harvest your spinach Plants\nIt takes about 6 to 8 weeks from planting to harvest. Once the leaves reach 3 to 4 inches in length and 2 to 3 inches wide, you can harvest your spinach leaves from the base of the plant.\nMake sure to harvest leaves before they start to flower (bolting). Once they start to flower the leaves become bitter.\nHarvest spinach carefully by removing the outer leaves. Either pinch at the base of the petiole with your fingers or use Pruning Secateurs to cut the base of the petiole.\n\n\nImage Source\nAdvantages of Palak/Spinach:\n\nGood for skin, hair, and bone health.\nReduce the risks of causing cancers.\nLowers blood pressure.\nControls blood sugar levels.\nPrevents constipation and helps in maintaining a healthy gut.\n\n\n \nAdverse effects of spinach: \n\nSpinach contains good amounts of calcium and oxalates that are good for bone health. It is not recommended for people who are at risk of developing kidney stones because calcium oxalate present in spinach may lead to acid and mineral salt build-up and result in forming kidney stones in them.\nGenerally, vitamin k1 is essential in blood clotting in our body. People who use blood thinners are not supposed to intake spinach (in larger amounts) as it is rich in vitamin K1.\n\n \nFrequently asked questions: \n1. How long does it take for spinach from seed to harvest?\nIt just takes 40- 45 days when you maintain spinach plants properly by keeping a regular check on pests and diseases. Because pests, diseases, weeds are the main reason to slow down the growth of any plants.\n2. Can I expect a healthy harvest from bolted spinach plants after cutting their leaves and flower stems?\nSpinach is an annual plant that completes its life cycle in one season after producing seeds. If once spinach started producing flowers (contains seeds), the quality of the leaves gets altered making it unsuitable for consumption. So you cannot expect a further harvest from the bolted spinach plants.\n3. Does spinach grow back after cutting?\nYes. spinach does grow back to give you two or three harvests if you do not harm the growing point (base of the stem) of the spinach plants. So cut leaves 1 or two inches above the base of the stems.\n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

Addition of fresh coriander leaves makes your food healthy, spicy and gives perfect taste. Grow coriander plants from coriander seeds in your garden. Decorate your food with fresh coriander leaves.\nFollowing are the 4 steps to grow coriander plants in pots or in your garden.\n\nImage Source\nStep 1: Choose the best time to plant\nIt is a plant that grows best in the sun. But too much of heat during summer will also be negative, so keep the plants positioning to get the shade during the high temperature. They won’t survive in cold weather but it does not like extreme heat either. The best time to start planting is in between the months of March and May.\n\n Image Source\nStep 2: Choose either pot or your garden to plant Coriander seeds\nYou can either grow it in a pot or in your garden.\nIf you want to grow in a pot then choose one which is 18 inches wide and at least 10-12 inches deep.\nIf you want to plant in a garden then choose the best place where you find the organic soil with enriched nutrients.\nEach round seed is technically a fruit which contains two seeds as shown in the picture. Each seed will grow as an individual plant.\n\nYou can sow whole seed or you can split and sown. If you split and sow seeds, it will increase the germination rate.\nSow seeds 3-4 inches apart and 1/2 inch deep into the soil.\nKeep the soil moist by spraying the water until seedlings germinate but do not over water it.\nMaintain at least 6-8 inches space between two seeds, otherwise, it may invite pests and diseases due to overcrowding.\n\nImage Source\nStep 3: Germination of coriander seeds    \nCoriander will start to germinate in about 2 to 3 weeks. It requires plenty of moisture to germinate, so make sure to water them frequently also ensure that they get a good amount of sunlight.\n\nImage Source\nCare for Germinated plants\n\nWater them frequently so that soil never dries out. But do not over water it.\nMake sure they get good sunlight. In case of high temperature, provide the plants with shade or keep the pots inside.\n\nKeep the soil rich in organic matter. You can add fertilizers like potting mix or compost if you wish to.\n\n\nStep 4: Harvest the Coriander plants\nWhen the plants reach about 6 inches tall, it’s the time to harvest your plants. Usually, it takes 45 to 60 days to harvest. Harvest the leaves and stems from the base of the plants using Pruning Secateurs or by hand.\nUse fresh green leaves in your food. Avoid older or yellow colored leaves which may taste bitter.\nAlso note, not to harvest more than one-third of the plants as it may weaken the plants.\nOnce you have done with the harvesting of leaves, the plants will continue to grow for two to three more cycles.\nKeep harvesting the fresh leaves.\n\n\nImage Source\n\nHow to grow coriander from store brought coriander: \n\nTake healthy coriander stems that have roots.\nCut the stems leaving 2 inches of stems above the origin of the roots.\nPlant these stems in any fertile organic potting mix at 3-4 inches apart.\nUse well drained soil to plant coriander stems as clay soil retains water for long time and result in root rots.\nWater them thoroughly after planting. Thereafter water them when the top inch of soil becomes slightly dry. \nWater plays a major role in keeping these coriander stems alive because it is the only source that allows them to intake nutrients. Leaving the soil dry between watering may damage the cutting as they do not have any leaves to supply food by performing photosynthesis. \nStems may become dry but you will notice the new growth within 7-14 days of planting.\n\n \nHow to grow coriander for seeds:\nWhen you grow coriander to harvest seeds, you need to wait some more days until the plants flower, set seeds. When the green seeds turn yellow- brown, you can harvest the seeds from them. It takes around 90-110 days from seeds to harvest. Meanwhile water them regularly and add any organic fertilizers for every 20 days right from flowering to harvesting. Fertilizing helps in boosting the flowering and seed setting in coriander plants. Follow these care tips if you intend to harvest coriander seeds.\n\nDecide whether to leave the plants to flower or not\nYour plants may start to flower (Bolting) sooner or later. At this point, the plants will stop to produce fresh leaves. Now it’s your choice to leave the plants to flower or not.\nHowever, if you want to harvest coriander seeds from your plants then you can leave it to flower. Once the flower dries, you will be able to harvest seeds. Either you can use the harvested seeds to cook or save the seeds to plant for the next season.\nAlternatively, you can allow the seeds directly to fall into the ground which can make self-sow, and provide you with more plants.\n\nBolting:\nBolting is a natural process of plants when they start to flower. While growing they start to bolt when they go through stress. The stress can come in different ways. It could be the following reasons.\n\n\nHigh temperature: Coriander needs a moderate temperature of around 20 degree Celsius. If the temperature is high beyond 36 degrees it may result in bolting. In case of high temperature provide the plants with shade to avoid this or you can keep the pots inside.\n\nIrregular watering: Make the soil contains moisture during the growing stages of plants. Keep watering the plants till water drains out of the drainage hole.\n\nLack of nutrients: Use potting mix or composter to make the soil good enough with organic nutrients.\n\n\n\nImage Source\nDifference between coriander and cilantro:  \n\n\n\n Coriander \n\n\n Cilantro \n\n\n\n\nCoriander comes from\nCoriandrum sativum \n\nCilantro also comes from Coriandrum sativum \n\n\n\nIn US seeds are called coriander\nLeaves and soft stems are called cilantro \n\n\n\n\nPests and Diseases:\nPests like Aphids and red spider mites might attack your plants. The most common aphids are greenfly or blackfly. They form clusters at the top of the plants and around new areas of growth.\nYou can avoid this pests and diseases attack by spraying Neem Oil.\nAdd 2 to 5 ml of neem oil to a liter of water and spray on the plants. Repeat the spray once or twice at a week interval if the infection is severe.\n\n \n\nImage Source\nDiseases of coriander/cilantro: \n1. Powdery mildew: caused by fungus Erysiphe polygoni. Many white powdery patches on leaves and stems are seen which coalesce to spread all over the leaf and stem surface. It results in deformed leaves, premature sterility, and the absence of seed formation.\n2. Damping-off: it is caused by seed/soil borne fungus. Seedlings/plants wilt and collapse due to rotting at the ground level. It is often followed by root decay. Using healthy seeds and growing media that are free from pathogens is very important to prevent the plants from damping off.\n3. Blight: it is caused by bacteria and fungus and is associated with the appearance of dark brown spots on stems and leaves.\n \nTips for germinating Coriander seeds\n\nAlways make sure to get good quality of coriander seeds to grow.\nUse the seeds which are meant for sowing purposes.\nUse fresh seeds\n\n Fertilizing soil is an added advantage.\n\nAdvantages of Coriander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost frequently asked question of  coriander: \n\n \n1. Should I soak coriander seeds before sowing?\nThere are many ways to germinate &amp; grow coriander seeds. You can sow them directly in soil without soaking or you can go for soaking over night. The main difference between them is when you sow seeds without soaking it takes more number of days to germinate, compared to soaked seeds. One more way is sowing of whole seeds or split seeds. Even here difference exists in number of days to germinate. Whole seeds take more days compared to split seeds. \n2. How long does it take to grow coriander plants from seeds? \n \nCoriander plants usually take 40 to 45 days to grow and reach harvesting stage. You can start harvesting cilantro or coriander leaves just from 35 days, depending on your purpose of use. \n3. Can I grow coriander from store bought seeds? \n \nYes for sure, provided they are of good quality. But if you are beginner in gardening, you better go for purchasing seeds from authenticated sellers. Because the seeds bought from the store may not germinate some times. So instead of loosing motivation for growing plants you can start sowing with the good quality seeds.  \n \n4. What are common pests of coriander? \n \nUsually leafy vegetables suffer from leaf minors, aphids, white flies and some times cut worms. For controlling all these sucking and cutting pests spray neem oil once a week as a prophylactic measure. \n \n5. How to crush coriander seeds before sowing?\n Drop the coriander seeds in any plastic bag. Place the bag on any table/surface. Take a chapati roller or any cylindrical object to crush the seeds. Place the object on the plastic bag that has seeds in it and roll it back and forth gently. By this coriander seeds get crushed slightly. Crushing seeds help in reducing the time of germination of the seeds.\n6. Is it hard to grow coriander?\nIt is always very simple to grow leafy greens like coriander. The only thing that makes growing coriander difficult is, that they always dash to flower and set seeds to pass on to the next generation under stress. Bolting can mostly be avoided by not growing coriander herbs in summers.\n \n \n \nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "All About Growing Capsicum From Seeds\nGrowing capsicums or bell peppers from seeds is by far the most inexpensive way to get hold of a bountiful harvest of fresh, juicy bell peppers for your pizzas and burgers. If you are short of space and would love to have a kitchen garden, then bell peppers should be a wonderful addition. With a little bit of space, a good and solid container, enough fertilization and mulching will make growing chilies or capsicum in pots an easy venture. I have spent enough time in researching about the possibilities of growing bell peppers in pots in India and tried it out myself. As a result of that, here I present you all with my blog post about “How to grow capsicum in pots?”\n\nImage Source\nNormally, capsicum is a warm weather vegetable crop and hence if you are living in areas where sunlight is at a premium, then growing them in containers will be the best option. Growing capsicum in pots is as easy as eating a chocolate. Yes, that’s true. Trust me, initially, I thought it is a tough veggie to try growing but when I saw the plant grow rapidly, I couldn’t control my curiosity to see the first capsicum spring out!\nHere are few tips to grow capsicum in your home.\n1. Buy bell pepper seeds (either red or green) which is kidney shaped and brownish in color.\n2. Choose a tray pot, make sure the container has large holes so the water can drain away freely and also pick up available moisture from the storage tray.\n3. Sow the seeds in 2-inch depth with the temperature of around 20 to 25°C.4. The plant requires full sun to grow. The seeds require 3-4 days to germinate.5. Bell pepper is a slow growing plant, after 2 weeks of growth pinch off the leaves so that it will grow broader.6. Bell peppers are ready to harvest within 3 months.\nThere are two main things to consider when you are planning to grow bell peppers in pots in India. I have described each one in detail below.\nChoosing a container for the capsicum plant:\nThe first thing that came to my mind when I wanted to grow bell pepper is, why not use the mineral water can? Yes, that is what I did.\n\nImage source\nNormally, when you start growing bell peppers the containers should be about 10-12 inches deep and they should be very wide. Also, make sure there is enough drainage facility too. This kind of container can accommodate about two to three small plants. Simple isn’t it?\nQuality of seeds:\nAlways make sure you get good quality capsicum seeds to grow. There are many people out there who see seeds but not all are trustworthy. The first time I tried to grow capsicum in a pot, I bought seeds from an online vendor who guaranteed they are “top rated”.\n\nImage source\nThe seeds germinated well and the plant grew well too. The real shock came when the plant started fruiting. I was expecting big and plumpy capsicums but what came out were small and feeble ones! I was totally frustrated that I sought the help of some of my gardening friends, who in turn found out the culprit- yes, the seeds! Therefore, make sure you get the seeds from a trusted contact. The next time I bought from Trustbasket and the result- my little one enjoyed the juicy capsicums in his pizza!\nAlways start the seeds in a germination cup or seed tray. In this way, you can easily propagate them to the desired container.\n\nImage source\nThe seeds probably take about 3 weeks time to germinate, but once they are germinated the growth is rapid. It is always good to transplant the seedlings when they have about two to three true leaves.\nWhat to look for when growing capsicum in pots in India?\nWell! Now that you have got an idea about the two main things needed for growing capsicums, you should also be aware of few important things that should also be noted.\nThe position of the plant : \nNormally, capsicums need a lot of sunlight. If you are growing them in pots, then it is really an easy thing. All that you have to do is to keep the pot in a sunny spot. The plant should get about 6 to 7 hours of direct sunlight. Such plants tend to grow well and you will certainly get a bountiful harvest. However, you should make sure it is protected from strong winds.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nImage source\nGrowing medium or soil:\nThe soil is very important when it comes to growing capsicum in pots. A good potting mix is a must. It should be of the best quality, very fertile and well drained. If you are planning to get the potting mix from a vendor make sure to check for the quality or try to spend some time to make your own potting mix. Mine was a mixture of cocopeat + red soil + Plant food in equal ratio. It is always good to add a handful of neem cake to the potting mix to get rid of soil-borne diseases.\nWatering the plants:\nWatering is the tricky part. Capsicums need a lot of water but it doesn’t mean that they should sit in water! The soil should always be moist. Also, remember not to water the foliage. This will lead to fungal infection. It is a good habit to water the plant at the foot. Never, leave the soil to dry out.\nCaring for capsicums:\nAs with other plants, if you spend some time to care for your capsicum plant, the result will be just awesome! Here are few things that you should do.\nMulching the plants:\nMulching is always a good practice that will solve the problem of water evaporation from the soil. Just cover the base of the plant with whatever mulching material that you can get hold of, be it, paper, dry leaves, straws and so on.\nFertilizing the soil:\nJust like other plants, capsicums need good fertilizers to munch on. However, if you use a lot of nitrogen-rich fertilizer then it will just induce the foliage growth. Hence, make sure you give it sparingly. Panchagavya will work well. Feeding the plant with vermicompost will also do wonders.\nPruning:\nIt is always a good practice to pinch the growing tips of the plant. This will make the plant grow bushier. Pruning is not necessary for capsicum, however, it can be carried out if needed.\nPollination:\n\nImage source\nThese plants are self-fertile and hence you need not worry about pollination. However, if you wish to get a bountiful harvest then just shake the plant when it is in the flowering stage. Also, it is good to deadhead the flowers from the plant if it is flowering early. Also, if you want the already set fruits to be bigger and better, you can stop the fruit formation by pinching off the flowers at an early stage.\nSupport:\nOnce the fruits set in the plant, it is always good to give enough support to the plant. I used a bamboo stick for this purpose.\n\nImage source\nJust poke the stick near to the plant and tie it to the stick. This will be a good support to the plant.\nPests and diseases to note:\nThere are two main troublesome critters that you should take care of while growing capsicums in pots. Aphids will start attacking once the plant starts growing. They are considered as the number one villain for capsicum plants.\n\nImage source\nUsing neem spray to avoid these critters will give you good results.

        "articleBody": "         \nGrowing green peas at home- All that you should know!\nI hope you would have loved my previous blog post about “summer squash”. I was wondering what to write about when this frisky thought of “green peas” came to my mind. Actually, I was munching on green peas when this idea popped out. Remember, when I say I was eating it, it is purely grown at home and hence the tag –“organic” can be applicable here. You may wonder it is a tough thing to grow green peas but trust me; this is just a simple thing as eating jalebis that you yourself make! Got the catch? Okay, now I am going to explain the process for the famous search term “How to grow green peas from seeds?” Buckle up and let us start now!\n\nImage source\nHow to grow green peas from seeds?\nIt is always a wonderful feeling to grow and harvest plants on your own. I especially love growing legumes. Harvesting them in batches (bunches, of course) is a splendid feeling, as your basket will be full in a jiffy. Growing green peas will give you complete satisfaction, especially with the “organic” tag attached to it. If you are planning to start a container garden, then I suggest adding green peas to the list will certainly do well. Power packed with plenty of nutrients, the fluffy texture, and the perfect blend it gives to the dishes, makes this a wonderful companion in your kitchen garden.\nThere are three main things that you should consider while thinking of the question “How to grow green peas?”\n\nWater, water and water. This plant requires a lot of water, especially if you are planning to grow in a container, you may have to water it thrice a day.\n\nFertilizers should be added on a frequent basis. Since much irrigation is involved, the plant needs as much nutrients as possible\nSunlight is the booster needed. Peas need enough sunlight for the growth and hence you should find a sunny spot for that.\n\nSeed sowing and germination:\n\nImage source\nBefore sowing the seeds you should come to a conclusion about the variety to grow. Normally, green peas are opted by many. Choosing the seeds is a tricky part. To make sure your seeds are of good quality, you can check them easily by soaking them in water. If you see some seeds floating, they should be kicked out! Fine as it is!\nFor container gardening, you should pick out the right size of the container for this plant. For gardens, a moist, sunny spot would do. Since this blog is purely about how to grow green pea plants in pots, we can concentrate on container gardening!\nThings needed to grow peas in pots:\nHere is a list of few things that you may need to grow in containers.\n\nA large or wide container. The larger the container is the better the drainage is\nA good potting soil\n\nOrganic fertilizers\nSeeds and\nTrellis\n\nContainer preparation:\nPreparing your container is a very crucial part and hence you should spend enough time for this. After all, it is where you are going to get your yield! It is always good to fill the container almost completely. Just leave about 1 inch of space on the top. If your container is huge, then you can fill the bottom with stones or dry leaves. I filled the bottom of my container with coconut husks. This helps with drainage and at the same time, the husks will decompose over a period of time. Brilliant, isn’t it?\nPotting soil and fertilizers\nUsing a good potting soil is very important. If you are using just red soil, then make sure to mix enough nutrients. I used red soil, with sand, organic manure in equal portions. Since peas are a legume, make sure you do not use fertilizers rich in nitrogen, as this will harm the production. Fill your container evenly with the soil mix and gently pat it. I love this step; the richness of the soil when touched with bare hands will give you a heavenly feel.\nHow to plant pea seeds?\nIf you are planning to sow seeds directly then just poke your index finger in the soil to create a small pit to sow the seeds. If the container is big it can easily accommodate two to three plants. Therefore, plan it well before. When using a germination tray then you will have to wait until the root ball forms and then transplant to the container. Click here to read some basic germination tips.\n \n\nImage source\nOnce you have sown the seeds in the container, make sure to water it. Another thing to note is not to cover the seeds with a lot of soil as it will create some problems with the germination. Use a watering can to water the soil. It should be moist but not wet. Keep the container in a place where it gets full sunlight. As I said before, peas need good sunlight.\nTrellis setting:\nSetting up the trellis is something that I love. Normally, I use the branches cut from other trees. However, you can use bamboo sticks tied together in a teepee shape. This will be perfect for that. In my case, I used dried branches from my custard apple tree. Peas need good support while growing, as they are climbers.\n \n\nImage source\nHowever, in the initial stage of growth, you may have to help them start climbing on the trellis. It is a beautiful sight to see the growth of the plant with the shoots and tendrils dancing beautifully in the wind.\nHow long does it take to grow peas?\nOkay, now is the tricky question that many of you ask. “How long does it take to grow peas?” “When can I harvest?” As always, harvesting is the fun part which I love to the core. Normally, you can harvest them in about a month from the date of sowing. However, this depends on the pollination too. Harvesting peas is a wonderful experience. Harvest them once they ripen.\n\nImage source\nThe pea pods should be plump, which is a clear indication that there are plenty of juicy, fresh peas for you. Once the harvest season has started, you should check the pods every day. Once you find the pods with the desired size, then take out your harvesting basket and start picking the pods.\nPests and diseases:\nAs always, you should also be aware of the pests and diseases that may affect your pea plants. There are four main diseases to look for.\n\n\nFusarium wilt: If your plant starts to turn yellow and wilt then it is a clear indication that fusarium wilt has started. This is a soil-borne disease and most of the plants succumb to this. The only remedy to this is to treat the soil with solarization.\n\nPowdery mildew: This normally affects the plants in cool and moist temperatures.\n\nRoot rot: If you are watering your plant a lot, then root rot will certainly affect it. The common symptoms are yellowing of the foliage, wilting and stunted growth of the plant\n\nUsing natural and homemade fertilizers and fungicides you can easily get rid of these. However, there are plenty of pests that will flock towards your plants once they start blooming.\nAphids: Not only green peas but plenty of other plants also get affected by these critters. The best way to get rid of them is planting plants that attract ladybugs.\n\nImage source\nPea weevils: Another creature that destroys those plants. They lay their eggs on the pea seeds. Once the eggs are hatched, they much on the entire plant.\nOther pests include leaf miners, nematodes, spider mites, and so on. Using a good and organic pesticide will prevent the damage caused by these critters.\nFriends and foes:\nYou would have heard the term “companion planting”. It is always a good thing to plant few varieties of plants together. Just as you feel happy when you are in the company of your friends, plants too behave in the same way. When it comes to green peas they love the company of the following plants.\n\nMint\nCoriander\nLettuce\nSpinach\nRadish\nCucumber\nBeans\nCarrots\nCauliflower\nBroccoli\nCabbage\nTurnips\nCorn\nParsnips\nPotatoes\nEggplant/brinjal\n\nHowever, care should be taken while planting the following. Make sure they are at bay, as peas do not like ‘mingling’ with them\n\nOnion\nGarlic\nGladioli\n\nNutrition value of peas:\nWhile munching on the green peas, I just thought about the calories that are being added to my body. My little one was also munching a bowl full of green peas and hence I got this sudden urge to check on the nutrition value of peas. As a result, here is the chart.\nCalories                                81\nProtein                                 5.5 gm\nCarbohydrates                  14.5 gm\nFiber                                      5.1 gm\nCalcium                                 25 mg\nPotassium                           244 mg\nVitamin A                               765 IU\nRiboflavin                            0.132 mg\nThiamin                                0.3 mg\nQuite happy and contented. I was on seeing this that I went to grab another bowl!\nHealth benefits of green peas:\n\nConsidered as one of the most nutritious of all leguminous veggies, this also has plenty of health-promoting minerals, anti-oxidants and vitamins\nIf you are lacking folic acid, then consuming fresh pea pods will help you gain that.\nFresh green peas come packed with plenty of anti-oxidants along with Vitamin A. vitamin A helps in maintaining a healthy skin and eyesight.\n\nNow that you have known all about growing green peas at home, then why not kick start it? The seeds at Trustbasket are quite noteworthy and have a good germination rate. P.S I bought mine here and that is why I am so confident! I hope you will share your experiences in the comments below.\nStay tuned for I will be back with another interesting blog post.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

        "articleBody": "All About Growing Summer Squash\nSummer Squash is a super vegetable to try this summer and How to grow it!\nHave you ever heard of summer squash? Well! For those who have never heard about it, count us in too. The moment we heard about this veggie we wanted to try it out in our gardens to see how it comes out and have a glimpse of the veggie itself.\n \n \n\nImage source\nAs things turned out, this is a super veggie power packed with a lot of vitamins and proteins to give you enough energy to carry out a day’s work or two! In this blog post, you are going to learn everything about this veggie right from germination till harvest.\nWhat is summer squash?\nSummer squash belongs to the zucchini family. One special feature of this kind of squash is that the fruit is harvested before it is matured. Tender and edible rind is the main thing to look out while harvesting this. The plant grows into a bush, unlike other squash and pumpkin. The short storage life of this veggie is the main reason for this name!\nHow to grow summer squash:\nIf you feel that this is one tough veggie to try and then mark our words, you are in for a surprise! Just like the others, this is quite easy to grow from seeds and we will explain you the process here.\n\nImage source\nBefore starting a lesson on how to grow summer squash you should know about germination and other stuff. You should also first understand when to plant this and how to plant it.\nSummer squash: when to plant?\nAs the name indicates, summer or pre-summer is the best time to sow the seeds. The moment winter passes away, and you are free from all the fog and mist, it is the right time to go with planting the seeds.\nHow to plant?\nFind out a perfect space in your garden. If you are into container gardening then it works fine too! Start with germinating the seeds. Here too, you have the choice of doing it indoors or outdoors. Many people recommend germinating indoors.\n\nImage source\nIt normally takes three weeks for the seedlings to be mature enough to be transferred. If you are planning to plant them in your garden, find out a spot that is sunny enough. The soil should be well drained. Summer squash prefers a lot of sun and hence they will thrive happily in sunlight. If you are growing in a container it works perfectly well because you have the option of placing the pot wherever you want to. We suggest growing the seeds in a seed tray if you are planning to grow them in containers.\n\nImage source\nIt is always a better thing to add enough compost and fertilizer before transplanting the seedlings. For container gardening, make sure you have a balanced mix of cocopeat, compost and organic manure. This will boost the growth of the plant. Mulching is a good option to enhance the yield because of the shallow roots.\nHarvesting summer squash:\nAh! Harvesting is that one part that many of us will love to the core. Take us for instance, the moment we grow a plant we automatically think about the harvest season! I am sure most of you will have the same euphoric feeling too! Summer squash develop very fast.\n\nImage source\nOnce you see the blooms check for the male and female ones. Normally, the male flowers come up on bare stems followed by females. As always you can easily distinguish between male and female. Female flowers have a tiny squash at their base. It is always good to hand pollinate the flowers to enhance production. Use a small paint brush for this and it will do wonders. One natural way to do this is to have plenty of bees in your garden and hence it is a good thing to plant some flowering plants to attract bees. There are plenty of things that you can do with the flowers too. Use them in your recipes like spicy bajjis or pakoras! Yumm..\nIt is always good to harvest the vegetable when the rind is tender. Over matured ones can be used for seeds. Always check the plants for squash because the fruits mature quite fast. It just takes about 8 or 9 days for harvest after pollination. If you have few over mature fruits and don’t know what to do with them, just scrape them out and add them to bread or things like that. A healthy option, isn’t it?\nYou should take care while harvesting. The leafstalks are prickly and they may scratch your hands if they are unprotected. Using a knife or a pruning shear is always a good while harvesting. Also, make sure to handle the harvested veggie with care, since you will be harvesting them at a tender stage.\nCommon problems and pests:\nPests are a common problem for all plants and summer squash is not an exception to that. The most common pests of all that attack summer squash is the cucumber beetle. They attack the seedlings and vines too. Sometimes mature and immature fruits too fall prey to them. Using a strong organic insecticide will prevent them from destroying the plant.\n\nImage source\nAnother pest to look for is the squash bug. They normally attack the vines just when the fruits begin to set. The mature fruits fall prey to them as they hatch in groups. Neem oil is said to be a good option to prevent them and repel these pests.\nSummer Squash also catch the powdery mildew disease and they can be treated with a variety of organic insecticides      \nManures and fertilizers:\nWhen it comes to summer squash the usage of fertilizers and manures is quite limited. They enjoy growing in a growing medium of red soil+cocopeat+organic manure. Just put a spoonful of a bone meal while transplanting the seedlings and they will be happy to the heaven.\n\nImage source\nThere is one thing that is noteworthy. Make sure there is enough space between two plants. They do not like to be grown in a crowd. They are quite plush. A month old plant will take up to four to five square feet of area.\nStoring summer squash:\nStoring summer squash is a tricky part. Since they are harvested quite early, they are very tender. Normally, it is good to cook the squash immediately after harvest. If you are just growing two or three plants for your family then it will be good enough. Make sure to check the plant once in two days right after pollination as they tend to mature fast. As mentioned before, use a sharp knife to cut the squash from the plant. Remember, the more the harvests are the more the yield is. Also only tender squash are a delicacy. Make sure to handle the veggie with care as the skin is very delicate.\nIf you are planning to store the summer squash for future use, just place them in plastic bags and refrigerate. Make sure to wash them before cooking. You should also note that the storage life of a summer squash is quite limited and hence you should use it within two or three days.\nSquash blossoms- a true delicacy:\nThe flowers of the summer squash plant are edible. They make a wonderful delicacy when fried with pakora batter. Use only male flowers for this purpose. However, while harvesting the flowers make sure to leave some male flowers on the plant so as to enable pollination. Some farmers, use the female flowers which are not pollinated as they are very tasty in some dishes. Normally, harvesting them in the afternoons, when the flowers are in full bloom is good. You can also store them in the refrigerator for about one or two days. If you have never tasted squash blossoms then count us, you are definitely in for a treat!\nNutritional value and health benefits of summer squash:\nJust because they are harvested quite earlier the nutritional value may differ from that of pumpkins and other kinds of squash. Remember, the peel is the powerhouse of nutrients and hence do not peel off the veggie while cooking.\nNutritional fact:\nConsidering there is one cup of sliced raw summer squash:\nCalories                            17\nProtein                              1.5 gm\nCarbohydrates                  3.5 gm\nFiber                                 1.5 gm\nCalcium                            17.5\nPotassium                        281\nVitamin A                          385 IU\nFolate                               25 mcg\nNote:  These values are just approximate\nSeed saving for future:\nIf you are planning to save the seeds for the future then there are many things that you should consider. One of the trickiest part to consider is, summer squash easily crosses with other variety of squash. This means the genetic code of the plant will be changed. Therefore, if you are planning to get the seeds of the squash plant make sure to place two plants separately from the other plants. Once they start blooming cover them with a small tent like thing to prevent bees and other pollinators. It is always good to hand pollinate the flowers to get a perfect summer squash. Once you get about two or three fruits set remove the other flowers and let them grow.\nCheck for the fruits if they are mature enough. Mature fruits will have hard rinds and the colour of the stems will turn brown from green. It is always good to dry the largest of the seeds as they are sure to germinate. Seeds that are preserved in good conditions can last up to six years. Therefore, you will have your own seed bank!\nVital tips to grow squash in containers:\n\nFull sunlight is the secret for growing a healthy summer squash crop. Make sure to place the pots in areas where there is enough sunlight.\nFertile soil and sufficient moisture are the other two main requirements of these plants. It is not necessary that you should apply manure to the plants, but it is a good practice to add a handful of compost to the grow bag while transplanting the seedlings\nLike other plants, the seedlings can be started indoors. We normally suggest using seed trays or paper cups for germination as it will make the process of transplanting quite easy. When seeds are germinated in a seed cup the root forms like a ball. This will make the process of transplantation easy as it does not stress the root ball much.\nA good distance should be maintained between two plants. As mentioned before, since the plants are plush they need enough space to grow freely.\nIf you have a good plan and spend a good amount of time in maintaining your garden then this veggie will be a sure winner among others. After all, growing these in India is a challenge and we trust this information will be enough for you to face it!\n\nAbout our seeds:\nAll our seeds are ideal for the climatic conditions prevailing in our country. They have a germination rate of more than 80% under ideal conditions.\nNow that you have got an idea about growing summer squash, we will come with a next interesting article about another wonder veggie for your home garden. after all, we know how passionate you are about gardening and we will make sure you get the most out of our blog.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

Beet roots can be grown all over the year if you are specific about color, texture, and quality cool weather would be the best.\n\nImage Source  GERMINATED \"BEETROOT SEED\"\nTo speed up germination soak the seeds in warm water for an hour before sowing. It's good you use coco peat based potting mix for sprouting seed which holds the moisture content. Start with a seedling tray/pot. Place the seeds around 1.5 cm deep make sure you space them between as it gets room to grow. cover the seedling tray or pot with a plastic cover for faster germination, for air circulation, make few small hole all over the plastic.\nStep 2: Choosing the pot/land and soil for growing beetroots\nIf you are planning  to grow Beetroot plant in a pot select quite big pot(\"terracotta\") of about 20 inches in depth and 20 inches in width. Choose a pot with a drainage hole, The idea behind a \"pot\" with a hole is if in case you over water their after chances of the Beetroot plant getting damaged so the over water flows downwards. It can be grown in grow bags of the same diameter. Place one plant per pot and if you want to plant it on a land select a place where there are enough sunlight and space for growing beetroots.\n\n \nImage Source GERMINATED  \"BEET ROOT SEED\" TRANSPLANTED TO POT\nWhen it comes to soil never get soil which lies around your place and use it for your plant to grow, It's acidic, lacks nutrient content which is not suitable for growing plants. Choose a nutrient soil (\"ORGANIC FERTILIZER\") with the potting mix ( \"DIY POTTING MIX\") helps to grow a healthy plant. As you are growing the plant at your home you can even use a skin of vegetables, which you peel off before cooking. It is a natural compost.\nStep 3: Watering and taking care till Harvest for beets\nWater the plant constantly in a proper proportion, it should not overflow which damages the plant. With concern to weather, it takes about 15 days for seedlings to appear.\nThe seedlings will be about 3-5 cm tall. Then you can transplant it to a bigger pot/land. Choose a place where the plant gets enough sunlight. If you are planting more than one plant sow one plant per pot, If on land space two-foot distance between each plant.\nIn rainy season water, the plant 5-6 days once as rainwater may flow directly into the plant. In summer water the plant regularly as there are more possibilities of the plant getting dried by using \"coco peat\" potting mix made up of coconut husk, It holds water that is moisture which prevents dryness for long period. The overall idea is to avoid over-watering and under-watering the plant.\n Step 4: Pests and Harvest\nIn the process of growth it's obvious a plant gets diseased, The common disease is leaf spot, The best way to avoid is cut off the leaf once seen and root-knot is the swelling of roots caused by worms.\n\nImage Source\nTo prevent diseases then there should be an alternative way other than using chemical pesticides, Petroleum based fertilizers and a lot more, Use \" Neem Oil \" which prevents diseases and helps to grow a nutritious crop.\n\n\" Neem Oil \"\nAs neem oil is quite concentrated, spray it on the affected parts of the plant twice a day. From the day of sowing the plant must be taken care it might be watering, using fertilizers for healthy growth or avoiding pests. The over all effort made leads in production of healthy organic fruits.\n\nImage Source\nTwo months from sowing the seeds beets are ready for harvesting, at this stage they are tender and size is of a medium orange. Say if you have planted the beetroots side by side in the same container or on the land, pick the beets and cover the space with soil because it does not affect the nearby plants which in turn gets good space to grow.\nHappy gardening.\nPopular Searches: Garden Accessories for Sale, Compost Bin India, Plastic Flower Pots Online, Contemporary Plant Pots, Hanging Pots Online, Colourful Plant Pots, Bird Feeders Online, Rectangular Planters Online, Small Pots Online, Flower Pots Online, Kitchen Waste Compost Bin, Balcony Railing Planter",

Overwatering also impedes its growth, which must be avoided.\nIn summer, water twice a day regularly/ winters 2 days once in case of rain not required. Watering is completely dependent on the plant, never let the plant/ soil get dried nor should water stand all around the plant making the plant tilt.
